0,It's the most popular show in the WORLD for a reason. It's amazing. Enough said.
1,"As an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content.

So when I saw the preview for ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows.

I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it.

The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time.

If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure.

If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. ""Game of Thrones"" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.

UPDATE:

I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation.

Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week.

A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait.

Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone."
2,"Do not believe any of those negative reviews. I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.

Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.

There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.

It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.

Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.

The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.

After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like ""Merlin"" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.

Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this."
3,"Ever since I've watched the last available season of GOT I haven't been able to get into any other show. I've tried countless new shows and nothing even comes close to GOT! The way the multiple story lines and characters Intertwine with one another is absolutely genius! The idea that someone created this entire world from their imagination is unbelievable. The acting is suburb and you can't help but to fall in love or despise the characters. The cinematography and CGI is stunning. You'll be completely immersed in Westeros! Wishing you could just jump in and be a part of the story! So many twist and turns and things you'd never expect. GOT is incredible and definitely worth your time! However, be warned! Once you start you won't be able to stop and TV will never be the same!"
4,"I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.

'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every ""country"", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books – but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.

Yet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes Martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. At the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie and John (and all the – many – others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for Joffrey).

There have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is – at the moment – in a league of its own. A joy to watch: breath-taking, epic – and highly addictive – Television. 10 stars out of 10.

5,"Seeing a review comparing this brilliant title to Lord of the Rings made me make an account here and post my very first review.

I had very high expectations from this series and I believed that it will (like most TV series) absolutely ruin the book. And I couldn't have been more wrong! Where do I start...

The cast is great, though not amazing with one exception - Sean Bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the North, Eddard Stark. The setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! Some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogs are just as they should be. Now to get to the part most people are interested in: What is this? What can I expect of the series?

THIS IS NOT LORD OF THE RINGS. Now that I got that out, I can continue. The very idea behind the series is a lot different. It's based around great families on different sides of the world, the stories their members have to tell and the secrets they hide. And there are many secrets, You will have a chance to witness small portion of them in the first episode. If you cannot follow the story just yet, don't worry! It's meant to be like that, you will eventually get to know all the characters and get involved in the story so much you will BEG for next episode just to see what happens.

What to expect? Plots, love, action, war, hatred, quite a few surprises and much much more... All that after the first episode. I really hope they will not ruin it as the series progress.

Conclusion: Do not miss this! Yes YOU complaining that the book is better. And everyone else."
6,"First of all, I am a huge fan of the books, and I find it exhilarating to see a show that is so close to what I made in my mind while reading it.

I see some of the reviews are complaining about the sex and violence, to me that is like going to a restaurant, order a steak and complain about getting meat..

They keep true to the epically written book, and they depict the characters in an excellent way.

With a few exceptions I would say they have made what will be an epic show here, and I would really hope that they continue for all the books."
7,"This TV series is magnificent! I read a book and I must say that A Game Of Thrones is one of the best books I've read. So when I first heard that HBO will do a series on the this book I was thrilled but I was afraid that they will not be done exactly by the book. But I must say that I was wrong and that the series is better than I thought it would be. Much better!

While I watched the first episode I had the same excitement as the time when I first read the book. HBO has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. Sean Bean was born for the role of Eddard Stark. Costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. Actors are perfect for the role they play in the series.

For me the biggest surprise of the series I figure Daenerys Targaryen. Emilia Clarke actress who plays Daenerys Targaryen is more beautiful than I imagined it would be and more beautiful than is described in the book.

The Wall is a lot different than I had imagined, but in a good way.

The series revolves around Eddard Stark and his family. He has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. Eddard Stark is ruler of the North and close friend of King Robert who needs his help in ruling the Seven Kingdoms.

The seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since King Robert took the throne. But nothing is ever as it seems. Within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. Across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. To the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures of myth and legend that have been forgotten."
8,"This show is superb! While I may be bias as the book series is my favourite book series of all, I still think the show itself is fantastic! It sticks loyally to the books and doesn't ""dumb things down"" for a wider audience. If you are worried you won't gain the same experience by watching the show before you read the books, fear not - It's the same experience, with a different medium!

Although, I guarantee, soon you will be so pulled into the world of Westeros you will run out and buy the books just to find out what happens next!

Sit back and enjoy, my friends - Winter is Coming!"
9,"Game of Thrones on HBO is a TV adaption of George R.R. Martin's books, a Song of Ice and Fire. For those fans who know and love the books, then you can't help but love the TV adaptation. It is difficult to translate books into movies or TV series, but HBO's GoT made it look easy. The characters, cast, scenery, costume, etc., all looked incredible, and gave me the feeling that I was inside the books themselves. Although not every little detail was translated perfectly, and nor should they be, the pilot episode was a grand achievement.

For all those Nay-Sayers out there: If you don't like the series, then you probably have never read the books or watched the countless behind the scenes trailers that helped those who didn't understand the complex storyline. Yes, this story is complex, its original, its fresh, and it is very exciting. The story line gets better with each episode. You also have to keep in mind that this story is an adult story, and as I said, it is complex. Simply put, HBO didn't dumb the story down, but rather remained true to the core of this epic fantasy. For those who have never read the books and found the pilot interesting, trust me it gets better and better. Stick with it."
10,"Love, betrayal, greed, murder, corruption All collides in mythical world of Westeros. George R. R. Martin's world is unlike any other fantasy world you have ever seen. The main conflict lies between two families: House of Stark and House of Lannister, but there are many more stores to be told

Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) is the main character of the series, and the story is mostly about him. Since HBO has staked a lot of money into this series, there will be a lot of colorful characters, just like it the books.

The art dept. has done a magnificent job by creating a whole new world from scratch. Costumes, armors, landscape, photography All has been done in well-known HBO way.

Travel along side your heroes, from the cold North, and The Wall with Jon Snow, across the desert-city on the South, with Ned Stark, and join Daenerys and her riders on a mission to retrieve the Iron Throne.

Let the Game of Thrones begin!"
11,The best thing i have ever seen No words to describe it
12,"What can be said that hasn't already been said about this show? Quite frankly, it's the greatest TV series ever created. Movie quality acting, set design, storytelling, cinematography, costumes....the one knock is in some of the early episodes CGI not being up to par (dragons mostly).

The show is brilliant in almost every way. Never before have I been as surprised by the outcome and been along for an unpredictable ride of what happens and what is to come.

My previous all time favorite show was Breaking Bad and there's a wide gap between GOT and pretty much anything else already out there. The word epic is thrown around too often these days as are 10's for anything that's halfway decent. GOT is as worthy as anything else being labeled as epic and deserves a 10 in an imperfect grading system."
13,"It is sooo damn good that you will see any other tv series as mediocre. There is no other tv series is close to this one. Must see..but be warned when you start this you won't like any other show as this one when it ends, we all will be feel an emptiness. Hell waiting for other season becomes harder and harder. Get ready to lose yourselves in westeros, Enchanted,dangerous,mysterious,brutal,emotional,action packet,thrilled,horrifying and beautiful fantasy world. What are you still waiting for wasting your time reading this. If you haven't started it already you have to start this MASTERPIECE RIGHT NOW."
14,"An enthralling masterpiece that wields the scale and magnitude of the world built by George R.R Martin with precision and impact. You would be hard-pressed to find a dull moment in a show so rich with brilliant action, intriguing characters and multiple well-balanced plots."
15,"One of the best TV series ever,one day i ll read amd the books cause i loved everything in this TV series, all the characters are just great. If you love the lord of the rings so you should definitely watch this masterpiece"
16,"A few years ago I dismissed this show as being terrible after watching a couple of episodes, but I gave it another try today and I totally changed my mind. This is definitely one of the best shows I have ever seen and I haven't finished watching the first season yet."
17,"Best you'll ever see and miss watching!!!!

Hopefully they make a sequel after Season 8."
18,It takes a lot to keep me involved and interested in a series. And Game of Thrones just nailed it. Period. End of story! My life will consist of weekends of reruns when it's over. I'm so sad!
19,"With an average score of almost 10/10 from almost 1 million users, do I even need to write a review? Oh well, why not?

No TV series or movies can be compared to GoT.

In many BS movies/shows you can predict the ending after watching it for a few minutes (good ones always win and the bad ones seem to be completely retarded, blind, and incompetent. Well, not anymore!!!

The story in GoT is absolutely amazing, filled with interesting and ""realistic"" plot twists and unexpected events.

Acting is great, costumes and scenery as well. Every character is unique and interesting, and its great watching them develop. Everything is top quality.

If you start watching this, be prepared to get addicted quickly - you'll just feel a strong urge to watch the next episode, and another, and another until no more episodes are left. And finally I want to say that the series is really wonderful at all, and the soundtrack has been a genius and has contributed significantly to the perfection of the series."
20,"This show has the emotional intensity and very much paced plot and editing. Great, world class, different and very capable cast. Acting is incredible, costumes and scenery as well. Each character is unique and fascinating, and it's extraordinarily watching them develop.

Mind blowing everything!!! Season via season there all really solid each season appears like an alternate show because of the vast story-line changes. It's sufficient to catch your minds and hearts."
21,"Game of Thrones, the best TV show ever! But y'all know that already.

There is nothing more that I can praise that hasn't been said on here already.

I'm just here to put my 2 cents worth in because I'm a huge fan.

I will admit I waited till the hype was still on during season 3 before I said ""ok, gotta see what all then hype is about"", and thus I binge watched the first 2 seasons and every season thereafter.

Pure genius! A perfect 10/10!"
22,Dont waste your time reading the reviews just watch the show. Best show on tv .
23,"With an average score of almost 10/10 from almost 1 million users, do I even need to write a review? Oh well, why not?

There is a downside to GoT however that needs to be mentioned: as many have stated, after watching it, you will realize that 99% shows/movies out there are not up to its standards. A show of this quality is rare indeed."
24,"Damn you George R.R. Martin! Don't do movies, finish the damn next book ... oh wait ... he did! OK! Than let's look at the series...

Well, above statement has a meaning: I read the books! Yeah, big deal, but when I did I always thought: ""It is not possible to do a movie about this!"" And I was right! ... but they did a series! And I can't really believe it, but: It (well, the pilot) is quite good! Never expected that!

Also funny how many people talk about the nudity and/or the gore. Yes you see some breasts and so on ... so what? This is a fantasy, that is realistic (if you didn't read the books and don't know, what I mean by that: Wait and watch the series ... and you will be surprised!) so the scenes are realistic too! I like that! Adds more to the feeling of the books!

The main problem is, that if you don't know the books you are quite lost with the characters and what happened to all of them. But I hope we will get deeper into the minds and backgrounds of those people! The cast for that is really well done and I hope for they can pass on the feelings I got when I read the book!

Overall: Great start, hoping for Brilliance!"
25,Best expensive Series.. Ever...😍😍😍😍i loved so much
26,"Unsure when it was recommended to me, but it is , the greatest film, show, experience, time, memory you will ever have"
27,"Seriously my life has been filled with emotions when watching this series. Watching Game Of Thrones makes me so fricking happy, please HBO make something as good or even better (that's hard) than this."
28,"This review is not about why this show is so great (see my 10 ranking) but a response to the haters who's comments I can't fully comprehend.

If you have never watched this show before and want a true perspective, see below:

1. If you absolutely ""in your bones"" hate fantasy, then this show is not for you. Even though this show is 95% about people and their attitudes toward power, government and corruption, there is 5% fantasy. If you can't get beyond the 5% then don't bother.

2. Yes there is a lot of sex. If this bothers you then don't watch. Is the sex always necessary to the plot? No, but it also doesn't derail the plot either. Pay TV like HBO has a lot of sex. If you are a puritan don't watch. The story and characters are so good that the ""overdone"" sex scenes are a minor issue.

3. Yes there is a lot of violence. If this bothers you don't watch. The violence is there to serve the plot. This show is a fantasy but is more heavily based on Medieval history. Would you be shocked to know that people lived harsh, short and often brutal lives 600 years ago in the real world. If you want PC and sanitary homogenized entertainment, then this is not for you.

4. Confusing plot- My response is yes and no. Yes, there are a lot of characters. Yes it is hard to remember all their names. Yes it is hard to follow all of the character interactions, what they are trying to do, who that hate, who they love, etc. If you want a TV show that ""spoon feeds"" you an easily digestible plot and a few easy to follow characters, then this is not the show for you. If you (like me) like to be challenged by a TV show and forced to think, analyze, guess and scratch your head, then you will love this show.

4. The acting is amazing- I've seen reviews that ""slam"" all of the actors. Are all of these people crazy? Have they ever seen good acting before? Do not believe any of these nay-sayers. Amazing acting and amazing casting.

5. The writing is excellent- Is is Shakespeare? No, but its extremely well written as is the source material. Since I originally read the books by George R.R. Martin, I have tried to read other books by authors like Stephen King, Dan Brown, John Grisham, etc. I've found that Martin's writing is far superior to these other authors. The show's writers utilize Martin's prose and often improve on it.

6. Stereotyping (typical fantasy stuff)- Wow, I can't believe this criticism. Well yes.. there are dragons. And yes.. there is magic. This is about a stereotypical as it gets. The entire point of the show is to take your typical ""fantasy"" and turn it upside-down. There are no totally good guys. There are no totally bad guys. Someone you hate in Season one, you may love by Season 3. Characters also act like real people. They are fully fleshed and not just cardboard cut out's. I guess if you are looking for stereotypical fantasy, this isn't it, but there is no way this is stereotypical."
29,"Everything in this show is fantastic. Action, actors, soundtrack, cinematography. AMAZING."
30,"I only started watching this show last summer on Sky box-sets, but I can honestly say this show is simply incredible. Firstly, this show is a medieval fantasy-drama but it is unlike any other fantasy film or television series you have ever seen. The show is based on George R.R. Martin's acclaimed 'A Song of Ice and Fire' novel series and it is an outstanding adaption of these great books. In later seasons, the show manages to heavily deviate from the book's contents and have actually surpassed the book series, and many characters who are deceased in the show are still alive in the books but the show's writers and producers have all managed to pull this off with spellbinding results. What carries this brilliant show is its numerous, but remarkably strong storytelling which manages to bewitch the viewer on the very first episode. Many of the shows characters, are instantly memorable and lovable, even the villains. All of the acting is outstanding and many of the show's stars deserve all their awards and should receive casting roles for their fabulous work on thw show. The medieval scenery on the show is incredibly realistic and believable it manages to send the viewers back in time. The settings are beautiful and filmed with exquisite precision in some of the most stunning parts of the world. Furthermore, the special effects and CGI are film-worthy and is what really brings this magical show to life. I don't wish to spoil a single plot point but all intelligent viewers and lovers of fantasy fiction should watch this show. Everyone I know who has watched has become instantly addicted so be prepared to be blown away. It is definitely not overrated in the slightest and is very worthy of your time and consideration. I consider it to be the most remarkable television series ever created by man. Grade A."
31,This show is the best thing I have ever seen in my entire life. I watched the entire 7 seasons in less than a week. My life literally stopped for a week and my only wish is to wipe my memory clean and live through that week once again.
32,"The best tv show i ever had a chance to wach... took me 3 days to finish all 7 season, best time spent in my life"
33,"After sitting down and watching the whole season in one sitting, I truly experienced something deeply engrossing, highly emotional, filled with dark plot twists, fantastic visuals, and storytelling of epic proportions.

Watching the whole season in one sitting blows most comparative movies out of the water, this is masterful cinema at it's finest.

Huge character development, on top of some of the best acting performances I've ever seen. From the lead characters to the peasants, wanderers, and barbarians every role in the whole show is excellent. Which I think adds vastly to it's depth. The scenery, the environment, the atmosphere - awe inspiring, breathless, and at times just magical.

This is by far the top TV series, the only thing I can see topping this anytime soon, is season 2. Which trust me, can't come soon enough. After this 10 hour marathon, I could probably watch another 50 hours straight. It's that engrossing, and with the way they left the ending of season one with so many questions unanswered and the plot developing, the second season should be even more amazing."
34,"Obviously you know or heard about mount Everest... Highest mountain peak in the world and everyone desires to climb up on it. That's the place of GAME OF THRONES in TV world. No other show I repeat NO OTHER SHOW is like this one... It's the just best. You will find everything hear... The CGI, action, emotions, excitement, terror, love, hate, betrayed , sex etc. Everything you know or you desire to experience.... I never read the book nor I intend to.... But this show is even greater than movies.... Lord of the rings look likes a kid before game of thrones and that's not exaggeration... Or may be a bit... But you gotta give it a time. Waiting for finale."
35,"I only began watching HBO productions a few years ago, so I had some catching up to do. I started with the Sopranos, and a fine choice it was. Ravenous for more of the same high quality, character driven TV, I turned to Deadwood. Again, my selection was rewarded with some absolutely tremendous viewing. Entourage, the Wire, Six Feet Under, Band of Brothers, Oz and Rome all continued to satisfy my viewing hunger. Then all of a sudden around 2009. It all stopped. Nothing new was out there from HBO.

Then out of nowhere in 2011, like a Mike Tyson right hook, WHAM! Boardwalk Empire came along. 12 joyous episodes of the highest quality TV around.

Then at just about the time I was recovering from the sheer joy of that, Game of Thrones came to air. Not a big fan of this genre, I sat down to watch it with a critical eye.....

Eight episodes later, my critical eye has decided that this is probably one of the best scripted, most perfectly cast and absolutely gripping TV series I've ever watched.

If like myself, you are a fan of complex human dramas, if you don't mind a bit (well a lot!) of violence and nudity, and if you love a good deal of intrigue, then this is undoubtedly a show you will enjoy.

Again, HBO I salute you!"
36,"I just had to make an IMDb account specifically to rate this show. There are a lot of ridiculously harsh reviews of this show that I find absurd.

The most common complaint seems to be too much sex. This is an HBO show. Yes, it will have more sex than any show you find on regular cable. But does it really have more sex than The Tudors or Spartacus, two really great premium channel shows? I find a lot of the sex is necessary to define the character's personalities and motives. The writers had to be creative here because it's not as if they can just describe the characters exactly the way the author described them in the book. People tend to show who they really are on the inside when they are having sex.

There seems to be a lot of viewers that don't like the show because ""it isn't the genre they care for."" If you watched this show and expected it to be anything less than an a violent, vulgar, epic, sexy fantasy story, then you must've been prepared to watch Twilight, and not Game of Thrones.

What makes this show so great is how quickly the story can change, even when it seems to violate TV show norms (i.e killing off a main role). Unfortunately, we can't really give the writers credit here, as they are just following the story.

Game of Thrones almost seems like it was written to be a TV show in the sense that it is entirely unpredictable. If you've never read the books, you will NEVER be able to guess which direction the show will start to go in and just when you think you've got it all figured out, something will change, leaving you guessing again and just dying to know what happens next."
37,"No matter how good something is (and no matter how terrible) you always have a small group of people who will disagree with the majority. Even when a show like Game of Thrones comes along there are still people who will inexplicably give it one star reviews. That's just nuts. Myself, I hate generic brainless TV shows like CSI but, being fair I think I would rate CSI Miami five out of ten. It's ridiculous tosh, but it's still has some positive elements to it. One of the fundamental problems with IMDb is people vote in an almost political way by unfairly giving a movie or TV show one star or for that matter ten stars, in an attempt to lower or raise the overall score. I thought of giving Game of thrones a nine because I very rarely ever give anything a ten. But then, despite not being perfect, it is one of the best and possibly most important TV series ever made.

For me the Sopranos is currently the most important TV show of my generation. Not just because it was great, but because every episode had the production values of a high budget movie. It made people realise that TV can not only be as good as a movie, but it can actually be better due the fact that you only spend ninety minutes with the characters of most movies as opposed to perhaps ten hours to the average HBO series. Then there's also the unscrupulous nature of Hollywood and it's grab the cash and run policies. A TV series gives you the time needed for a complex plot to unravel and to actually care about three dimensional and detailed characters as in a book. How many movies have failed to live up to the greatness of a book? I would argue most of them. Cloud Atlas being a recent example of a novel failing to have the same impact on the big screen. Even the Lord of the Rings saga (which I still think are great) look suddenly dated and thin when put side by side with Game of Thrones. Even with the extended editions, Peter Jackson and his team struggled to fit everything in. Despite plenty of positive changes, Lord of the Rings contained plenty of silly Hollywood 'additions'. I'm talking of things like Legolas doing some shield surfing in the battle of Helm's Deep. There's no shield surfing in Game of thrones. If anybody tried to mount a shield and surf it down some steps in battle there would be someone like Sandor Clegane to grimly cut his head off and stick it on a spike for trying to be a smart arse.

So Game of Thrones is important really important. It obviously has a large budget, that whilst not as high as Hollywood blockbuster, is still sufficient to make every episode look movie quality and to bring in an accomplished ensemble cast. You may never have heard of plenty of them. But they can certainly show some of those overpaid Hollywood A-listers a thing or two.

So what's so good? - Well we have a great cast from Sean Bean, Peter Dinklage, Liam Cunnigham, Michelle Fairley, Aiden Gillen, James Cosmo to name but a few. These may not be household names but you will recognise many faces and perhaps all the better for not being pampered A-listers. Sean Bean seems like he was born to play Ned Stark. I said that of him when he played Sharpe. But hey, he plays a grim northerner really well.



So, if you've made it all the way here, well done and thanks for reading. Now, Seven Hells, go and watch Game of Thrones for the night is dark and full of terrors."
38,"Where do I even begin? Game of Thrones is simply brilliant.

There is only one other television series which has managed to get me so emotionally involved, but I will not name it, for doing so would draw the focus away from this masterpiece.

Game of Thrones sends you to bed at night fearing for the life of your favourite character; you just don't know if next week's episode will be their last.

The writing is superb. I cannot stress enough how clever the writers are. It is a rare thing for someone like me to sit back and smile at so many of the bold, powerful and often double-edged one-liners the characters have. Here are a few examples:

""When you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die.""

""If you thought this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.""

""A day will come when you think yourself safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth, and you'll know the debt is paid.""

""DRACARYS!""

I get so excited just reciting some of those quotes in my head! Do you see what this series does to you?! Those one-liners are SO POWERFUL - and the best part is that they're all-throughout the series! Those lines alone are capable of exciting me beyond belief for the next season.

The characters are also phenomenal. Take Varys and Littlefinger for example: two unbelievably complicated, sharp, and quick-witted characters which when put together make for some truly marvellous dialogue. Dialogue? YES! Dialogue! They make otherwise trivial conversation oh-so-interesting because their words always carry many meanings. Or perhaps Cersei and Joffrey: how is it even possible for one to loathe them both so much yet love them at the same time? I don't know, but I love/hate them so much!

The setting deserves a review on its own! Breathtaking! You truly do feel immersed in Westeros when you watch Game of Thrones.

Oh and can we just take a minute to worship George R.R. Martin? Thanks. I'm petrified of what that evil man will do in season five but at the same time I can't wait.

Oh, and another reason this show is brilliant: dragons. And Daenerys. Oh I could go on for days about Daenerys...HODOR!

This show has everything you could possibly hope for: there is never a dip in quality - the show achieves a high-quality consistency throughout; the characters and cast are absolutely incredible; the plot is ever-so-complicated and ingenious with many different layers and sub-plots; the setting and cinematography are utterly fantastic; the show never loses pace or interest; and you are emotionally ENGAGED.

In a nutshell, if you haven't seen Game of Thrones, then you need to. But be warned: your emotions will be toyed with, your heart torn in two, and on the day that you are finally happy, ""your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.""

Oh, also, if you dislike nudity, gore, being upset, not-so-happy endings, or quality television and you'd rather watch people cook meth...look elsewhere.

WINTER IS COMING!"
39,"An epic tale of the struggle between good and evil. Game of Thrones is stunningly beautiful and a work of art out of the ordinary. Rarely have I been so moved by a movie / series. A must not only for those who enjoy a fantastic medieval adventure, but also for those who wish to be blown away by a brilliant storyline, strong characters, unexpected twists, beautiful scenery, captivating dialogue, fast paced action scenes... I could go on forever. You will hate the evil characters and love the good ones, or the contrary if you wish. To feel such strong feelings for the characters in a movie / series is the ultimate proof of what masterpiece Game of Thrones really is."
40,"I just can not believe how good this series is. Excellent actors, excellent dialogues, unbelievably good story-line, sets, costumes, atmosphere, camera, cuts, music etc, etc, etc.

I am normally not a person who writes reviews for something but i just watched episode 9 from season 6. I had tears in my eyes, i was screaming in front of my monitor and i was totally exhausted after watching this cinematic masterpiece.

I could have tried to write a very objective and proffesionall review about this series but at the end it is a highly emotional experience watching such perfectly made series like game of thrones."
41,"I'm not a very physical women as far as violence and killing are concerned in any shape or form, but I loved the historical slant of this TV Series.

What I really wish is that I was one of those women being ravaged like in another review I read. I actually laughed out loud because that was exactly what I was thinking. Brutally handsome men and sexy ladies...what a mixture! PLEASE continue with the style. It's fabulous! 10-10-10-10-10!

OH...and the locations were great too. I looked into the site and saw that it was Irelend...figures, because it's totally beautiful. Great job.

Oh...and my boyfriend is a fan now too. I made him watch it last night and he loved seeing the beautiful women bare their bodies and the brutal be-headings and fights. Of course he's a UFC fan too."
42,"I watched an encore last night and I was so enthralled with the grit and texture of the piece, so much, that I was emotionally and mentally whisked away into a fantasy world of passion. Passion of love, death, power and life. My lover and I watched it several times in a row last night, until we were totally and absolutely filled with satisfaction. It brought back all the great memories of epic films such as ""Braveheart,"" & ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" that we adored growing up.

We felt the acting was spot-on! The men were men...and the women...well, shall I dare say delicious! The costumers surpassed our expectations by again being accurate to the times and yet revealing a subtle teasing of the beautiful women's forms (Lena & Emilia)...and the locations were breath-taking. There aren't many films...and definitely NO American TV Shows that even come close to being as exciting to us, as this one. Lena is possibly the most lushish woman we've ever seen.

Being a history nut, I was thrilled with the successful attempt at depicting the brutality of the medieval era, including the sexual scenes. Traditionally, the women were mounted from behind by their lovers, which is accurate to that era...and it was exciting.

My lover and I took full advantage of the fantasy and ravaged each other after-wards. Thank you for Producing such an exciting and emotionally thought provoking TV Series.

Please...give us more! Especially Lena."
43,Best series ever! Watched it serveral times and it is the greatest creation to been made
44,"Having heard much and more of the popular HBO series Game of Thrones, I decided it was time to journey to Blockbuster and acquire mine own VHS copy of the show. So I loaded up my VHS rack, five of my favorite dogs, and a Costco-sized box of Reese's peanut butter cups into my trusty Honda Accord.

The only Blockbuster still in business is way in the South part of town, so I was in for a long quest. If it wasn't for the sugary sustenance provided by the Reese's cups, the companionship provided by my dogs, and the listening pleasure of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (unabridged) on cassette tape, I could have very easily gone mad.

Although many long years had passed, Blockbuster was just the way I remembered it. The same off-white plaster, squarish building, with blocky Blockbuster lettering on the front, and the promise of a plethora of VHS tapes within.

""I come seeking the Game of Thrones,"" I told the young man at the counter. ""On VHS. Please bring it to me forthwith.""

The young man, who's naming plate said Scott, was a dubious knave, clearly of lowbirth. He squinted his vacant eyeballs and knitted his bushy, bear-like eyebrows and said, ""I'm sorry, but we don't carry that on VHS.""

""Do not play such games with me, boy,"" I warned him. ""I see your Game of Thrones display right before my own eyes.""

""Yeah... those are DVDs. I can rent you a DVD?""

""A DVD? Do you take me for a fool, boy?""

""Hi, I'm Adam, the manager,"" said a trollish-looking imp-man. He had long snaggly yellow- brown teeth, and two large, watery eyeballs that seemed way too large for his head. ""Is there a problem here sir?""

""This guy wants to rent some VHS tapes,"" said Scott, the idiot.

""Okay. I understand. I am very sorry sir, but we no longer carry VHS tapes at this location,"" said the imp.

What game were they playing here? A video store without videos. A riddle worthy of my late tutor, Brometheus.

Clearly they were both liars. For some reason they didn't want to rent me the Game of Thrones, but why? What secrets were they trying to conceal?

But I was tired from my long journey. And I was starting to crash from the sugar from all the peanut butter cups I had eaten. And the sound of the dogs howling from the car reminded me that I hadn't fed them or given them water in a great while. I had no choice but to leave this cursed place.

""Psst."" On my way out of the Blockbuster, I heard a strange sound. ""Psst. Hey buddy. I heard you want a VHS.""

There was a hairy, hunchbacked man standing half in the shadows. He was clad in stinking garments. He smelled like a rancid applecart full of old cheese and rotting apples.

""I got all kinds of VHS-es,"" he whispered breathily. He opened his cloak to reveal a hidden collection of VHS tapes, more than one could count.

""Do you have Game of Thrones?"" I asked.

""I have Game of Throats,"" he replied. ""It's basically the same thing.""

""Fine, I'll take it."" I gave him five dollars.

After watching Game of Throats several times, I have come to the conclusion that the production values are poor, and the script is pretty weak for an HBO series. But despite all that, it is just as captivating as everyone says."
45,"I was reluctant to start watching this, mostly because I am *so* unique and different (in case you missed the sarcasm in the text, I'm being facetious). In all seriousness, I don't know why I avoided it for so long, but I wish I hadn't. This series is awesome.

I also didn't realize that it actually delved into items such as dragons, witchcraft, etc. I really, really like it and I'd recommend giving a few episodes a shot to see whether or not you like it. Please don't judge it on the snow scenes. That is the only storyline that I seriously don't get, and wish was cut out - I feel like those people have been lost in the snow for forever."
46,"when i started watching GOT.I thought that its gonna take some patience to get myself to like it. Wrong

By the middle of the first episode i was hooked. By the end of it I was addicted. Every episode has the tendency to surprise...or id rather say shock you and keep you thinking about it for some time.

The fact that its on HBO promises violence....and hell of a lot of nudity, but not forced. Things don't happen just cause they gotta.

The characters are perfectly placed and cast well. The writing is powerful and at times dark.

All in all if you haven't started watching yet , now is the best time to watch the first two seasons because its a helluva good show ."
47,"I know about the books but i never read the story.

It is nice to see that a series looks so great. I did not want to spoil myself with reading the story since i bought the book but kept away from it.

The cast is awesome, the settings are great, the plot is very mature and well done. Only thing i am afraid is that material is gonna be compressed because of time constraints, but perhaps i will be wrong.

I hope much more success than actual viewer ship right now but i am sure this series will achieve a cult status down the road with more fans discovering this each day when the series is done when it is done! cheers it was worth the wait!"
48,"Despite being acquainted with Martin, and multiple recommendations of the books by friends of good taste, I have never read the series. I saw trailers for the HBO series, and they looked lovely, but my wife and I never quite found the time to try it.

A couple of days ago my wife wasn't feeling well, and we wanted to watch something...and a teaser about the second season caught our eyes. We both admitted to curiosity, so we started the first episode.

The next day we finished the last of the ten episodes making up the first season. We never do this kind of viewing marathon, but Game of Thrones grabbed us completely.

The acting varies, sometimes by intent and sometimes by the capacity of the actors, but the overall quality is far above average for TV drama. The cinematography is superb. There are visual elements from the season that I'm still processing two days after the marathon. (The last television I saw that had this combination of beauty and quality was Downton Abbey, and I never would have thought to link the two until this moment.) Best of all? There is a strong story, with multiple lines, and I have to think about and figure out the ways in which it works. Nothing is handed to me, and I often have no idea what will happen next. I have a chance to discover this world, and figure out parts, at least, of how it works.

I have been delighted by the first season, and now am eagerly waiting until the second season begins. I have a nasty feeling that I have the first book in the series lurking in my bedroom, and I don't know whether I can resist the urge to begin reading...."
49,"This is the first time I have watched something cinematic, and been so blown away that I had to read the books. FIRST TIME. EVAR.

Normally you read the books, and then you watch the movie and you're so disappointed, right? Not this time.

I watched the series and was amazed. I went out and bought all the books immediately, and finished them in a couple of weeks. ALL 5 BOOKS.

Basically, the series entails struggles between the bourgeoisie of the kingdom of Westeros. It's a relatively new country (notice how I said relative?) and the story mainly focuses on the family of Starks. There is an overarching battle brewing, involving strange creatures from the north. However, the threats are frustratingly ignored due to all the tensions within the kingdom.

The story is realistic, and gives the each of the characters astounding depth. It has twists and turns that literally make you gasp and flip out. There is sex and gore, and to be honest, I like the sex and gore. The show has enough that it makes it realistic. In fact, it's the most realistic killings that I've seen. Ever. If you stab a guy through his jugular with a lance, yes blood is going to come spurting out. Yes, it's in medieval times. People have sex for kicks, and there are prostitutes. DEAL WITH IT. The best part is that the show had just the right amount of it, without using it as a crutch.

The characters are portrayed so beautifully. That's the only thing I can really say.

Basically, you'll love it.

And this is coming from a teenage girl who does not even look like she reads fantasy, much less watches it, or talks about it."
50,"Let me first state that I have not read the books, so any and all of my opinions are solely based on this series.

So, what do I think of it? Well, to be honest I think it is the best TV series I have ever seen in my currently 33 years of life! I admit that I might be a little biased as I usually have a thing for the ""fantasy"" genre, but I guarantee that anyone who feels that way will absolutely love this. I have only seen up to episode 6 as of this review, and I will not make any comments about the characters or the story, as I do not want to introduce any spoilers, but so far the quality of this series (in everything) is just breathtaking. I could not be happier!"
51,"To be honest, at first I can't really understand why the show is good. I even made a post on my personal blog saying the show lacks of newbie tutorials, especially for those having hard time remembering faces and names. After watching the show twice, after watching the video reviews form the Youtube, I gradually understand that every details in this show matters, containing abundant information out there. So for me, the 1st time I was like: it's a good one; the 2nd time I was like: breath-taking. Now I am on my 3rd time. Subscribe HBO and watch it!"
52,"The movie has very good actors, very good screenplay and great excitement. The series surprised me over and over again. A good bond between first and last season."
53,"Marvel Cinematic Universe is my most favourite movie series and Game of Thrones is my most favourite television series I have ever watched. Before I started watching this, I didn't have a good view on this series and used to think that it was useless. But trust me.... After I started watching this, my idea completely changed and I became a hardcore fan of this amazing series. Those who haven't watched Game of Thrones are definitely missing one of the greatest silver screen wonders. I request everyone to watch this before Season 8 comes out in 2019. Believe me, you will thank me for taking my advice to watch this spectacular thing."
54,"I too have eagerly been awaiting this show, hoping against hope that it would actually be GOOD. I'd rather shove razors into my eyeballs that watch disappointments like Legend of the Seeker, Robin Hood, or any other pile of recent Hollywood ""glop"" that is passing itself off as fantasy fiction TV these days. Luckily, Game of Thrones lives up to its hype and, in my humble opinion, may actually change the way fantasy television is made from now on.

Reviewers in this thread have already provided the basic outlines of the story, so I am not going to bother with that. What I will do is provide the top six reasons to watch this amazing series:

1. It has child actors...and usually I avoid shows with child actors like the plague. They irk me. But Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) and Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark) actually give two of the best performances in the series. They aren't the type of child-actors that you feel like giving a good smack to.

2. It is dirty! That's right. Not everyone wanders around with modern hair-dos from Rodeo Drive, and never gets dusty. People are costumed and adorned as they would have been in medieval times. Does Lady Stark put on a fancy new dress when the king comes to town? NO! Do the villagers all have perfectly-laundered and pressed garments? NO! Are the castles and palaces all sparkling clean? Heck NO! This really just adds to the realism of the whole series.

3. Peter Dinklage. Even if the character of Tyrion Lanister had been a regular-sized man, this performance would still be Emmy-worthy. After a while, you begin to forget that Tyrion is a dwarf, until he reminds another character of it in the story. He is the perfect, drunken fool with a brain born for stratagem.

4. The Opening Sequence: The theme song is one of those tunes that will get stuck in your head for days. That's a bit annoying, but having the clockwork map in the opening sets up everything beautifully. A viewer gets an idea of the scope and world of the series.

5. The Sex: Some people have been whining about it. Well, this show was never meant for Mormons (no offense to Mormons...I watch Big Love too). Often shows have these boring, long, speeches of people explaining things. They go on and on and are necessary, but DULL AS DITCHWATER. What Game of Thrones does, is allows characters to give these endless expositions that viewers NEED to hear to understand the story, while also throwing in a bit of raunchiness. It works! No longer boring.

6. Lena Headey: I bet everyone thought I was going to mention the performance of Sean Bean. Yes, he is perfect for his role. But I think Ms. Headey really shines as Queen Cersei. She's definitely the villain...yet you can't help but like her a bit. She has this amazing smirk too that almost looks like she is about the laugh and cry at the same time. You can see there's always a lot going on in her head, but can never tell what that she's actually thinking. Where do her actual loyalties lay? It's a mystery...and that makes her character even that much more intriguing.

So, those are enough reasons for now. There are countless more. Watch the show. And if you don't like it? Well, you're either dead inside or simply dead."
55,"Where to even start...? This HBO TV Series is absolutely awesome! Without giving anything away, the show gives you all the drama and action you can ask for. From lies to war to sex to death, it's all in there.

Not only is the acting spot on but holding true to the books written by George R.R. Martin are excellent. There is a little ad hoc changes but the books and the series is pretty much on par. What is like about the series is the realistic feeling of really being part of the action and part of the fantasy world. This is a huge bonus for followers of the books and series.

Another bonus is that George R.R. Martin is not afraid of to stay from the status quo from other genres of this type. Mr. Martin has repeatedly said that no one is safe in his books. This is awesome as your always on edge awaiting the next moves from the key players in the show. This is an absolute must see TV series."
56,"Love this show, love this show, love this show! Action, betrayal, strong women, handsome men, realistic costuming, great casting, great story . . . The only thing wrong with this show is the pacing. My husband and I DVR what we want to watch so we can watch at our schedule and half way into the second episode my head is still spinning from the information-overload. I'm beginning to make the connections in and between the families and it is beginning to come together. I know that ""Game of Thrones"" is book-based - hopefully, they will not stop at the end of this first book of A Song of Fire and Ice series. I have not read these books, but plan to now!"
57,"That's right, GOT gonna be THE classic serie of our time! It's just perfect!"
58,"Game of Thrones is unprecedented. Not only in grandeur, budget and scale, but in sure nerve and complexity. It will not be parallelled for many years to come and it shouldn't be.

It does play with some serious themes, which are, by the way, historically accurate to an extent, yet it never outplays its hand and no matter how far they go, people will come crawling back. That is the key to great story telling.

The way in which the series conducts itself is so unheard of and unique it took me the whole length of the first three seasons to decide whether or not I liked it. No matter how many times I thought it best to stop watching this nonsense, the more I couldn't help myself. I pushed through and the rest is for the maesters.

You will be shocked, rocked, infuriated, saddened, disgusted and enthralled. Yet through it all, the blood, the horror and the gore, you will love it. However that fact makes you feel at the end is for your own contemplation."
59,"I'm just joining the choir in saying that this is a truly amazing show. There is very little negative to say about it. Everything clicks together: the acting is beyond fantastic, the production values massive, the visual design convincing yet just otherworldly enough to feel unlike our reality. The dialogue is truly exceptional: In this series simply watching two characters talk can be just as, if even more, exciting as any swordfight or heroic quest. All the major characters are well-rounded and excellently cast. A special mention must go to the child actors, all of whom are simply fantastic in their roles. Despite there being a ton of characters they all have a part in the story, and the individual stories rarely drag on.

It's actually easier to list the few nitpicks one might have about this series than try to explain all that is good about it. First, some of the characters sometimes border on caricatures, especially King Joffrey. Second, the massive amount of nudity and sex feels at times gratuitous, sometimes hanging on the edge of good taste and can make you feel slightly dirty watching it. Third, though not much of a criticism, more of a thing to be told is that there is some grisly stuff on display in the series which can be hard to watch, especially during the second season.

But beyond those three tiny nitpicks, one can find very little to criticise about this series. This is, quite simply, one masterful series, and is showing no signs of slowing down."
60,"This is by far the best thing on Television, better than a lot of movies in fact.

This is what you get when you take an amazing story and put British and American heads together :) truly spectacular

Well written, true to the books, well acted, and considering all the different character stories incredibly engaging.

Only gripe ... more than ten episodes a season please...

Cancel all this reality crap and spend More money making shows like this.

a truly intelligent well thought out piece of television"
61,"We had the HBO screener copy sitting around for months with no interest in watching it. We weren't sure what to make of it but I'm used to seeing the terrible mini-series set in medieval times attempts on television, so I was weary of GOT. We ran out of things to watch and so popped in the first 2 episode that came on the Emmy screener copy and we were blown away, and bummed there were only two episodes on it. I've stopped watching it so I can read the books, which are also amazing and page turners. This isn't a genre I would normally enjoy reading but it's so well written that I'm really into it. Also, knowing what's going on in the series helped me understand what is going on in the book. It's very detailed, in an almost Jane Austin kind of way and uses words we don't use in modern time, not to mention, a lot of character names that aren't very modern, so it takes a bit of thinking in the beginning to catch up and understand what is going on. But you get used to it pretty quickly and then it just flows. I would highly recommend this for anyone. My dad likes crime novels but I plan on giving him a copy of the book because I'm pretty sure he would like this. Would it be blasphemy to say it's as well written as 'The Hobbit?' Sorry, it's just really well written and a gorgeous and epic show, and as good as production value in any movie. A must see and a must read."
62,"Television as a medium rarely rises above mediocre levels of quality, concerned only with ratings to up its publicity income. Yet, every once in a while a truly remarkable achievement flashes briefly before the eyes of those carefully looking. Game of Thrones is such an achievement. Its carefully chosen location and cast, the seamlessness of its narrative and character development and its unrestrained but cautious building of its own fantastical world work so well together that a viewer could not be blamed for thinking it all came together magically.

Fantasy is a complicated genre. So much of it is clichés and replaying of old ideas, and yet, when done right, its worlds can successfully reshape our entire thinking of our own. Game of thrones begins with a beautiful introduction of its world in its opening credits, which in these days tends to be reduced in so many shows to the series titles and the producer and director credits. In the opening, we understand the layout of the terrain, and immediately perceive the importance of the divide of the map by ""The Wall"". This introduction is very clever, as it helps to visualize all the movements of the many character in the game of thrones.

As for the characters, rich in detail and significant and intertwined story lines, they are one of the biggest treats. You care about them the moment they come on the screen, and even if most can be identified as good or bad the moment you see them, the narrative manipulates both them and viewer enough to carry us constantly into unforeseen narrative developments.

Without spoiling its hard to speak of its themes, but all that is common in fantastical stories you will find here, from betrayal and honor, and manipulation and love, but with a more brutal and uncompromising view than most other shows. Even if dragons play a part, this is not a child's show. It's themes are that of adults.

The winter is coming, and it will be a long wait until the next season."
63,"I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.

There have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is – at the moment – in a league of its own. A joy to watch: breath-taking, epic – and highly addictive – Television. 10 stars out of 10."
64,"GoT is life and I can't wait for S8.Story, script, characters and CG etc and scale is great.I don't know what would I do after S8.One Episode of GoT is better than. Movies."
65,"Okay i admit it, i never thought i'd be watching a series such as this. I only started watching it because one of my favourite footballers watched it! And i was so addicted, an amazing show with a great storyline. I love how some of the characters are so lovable and others are not. My favourite definitely has to be Tyrion Lannister, Arya Stark and Jon Snow. Its so hard waiting nearly a year for the new season to start again but I'm glad there are books which i am hoping to read soon. It can be quite difficult to grasp the storyline at time especially because i am not used to shows such as this, but listening carefully and sometimes just googling stuff i don't understand really helps. I finished all four seasons in four days which as you can tell i was very much addicted. I would recommend all viewers to watch!"
66,"... as I am writing this.

If the first season seems boring to you (that seems to be the biggest complaint I've heard from people who don't like the show) just push through anyway. If by episode 10 you still aren't hooked, I'd be really surprised.

It's fantasy medieval material with lots of characters, plots and settings. Almost all of the characters are interesting and multidimensional, supported by very good acting for this type of show and for the immense quantity of characters involved (and half a dozen of them bringing really high level acting talent in general). Almost every character has their own backstory that makes their actions relatable, from Tywin, whose weak father almost lost their family seat, to Joffrey who got told he is the greatest of the world from his birth and became a spoiled brat. Hardly any character has ""plot armor"", so nearly anyone can die at any second with the momentum changing completely. The dialogue is excellent, based on the excellent writing from the books.

It has terrific world-building, a lot of attention to detail, amazing production value in every technical aspect (soundtrack is amazing, cinematography is impressive, the locations are great). There are great battles and special effects. It is full of unexpected but consistent plot-twists, and it's extremely focused on details and foreshadowing, which makes every scene potentially important and provides a rich ground for theories on future plots and speculation on answers for the dozens of mysteries the show introduces.

It is highly immersive and dark, good things happen to bad people all the time, as bad things happen to good people, which is frustrating and infuriating most of the time, but that makes it so unpredictable and also helps with creating connections to the characters and making you really invested in what's going to happen next."
67,"How is this show not number one. I mean I'm a massive fan of Breaking Bad. But Game of Thrones is on a completely different level to any other show out there. Including Breaking Bad. It has proper developing and unfolding story lines that are planned out from the beginning. It's unbelievably gritty and the character development is astonishing. The characters are real and you feel real emotion when something happens to one of them. Game of Thrones treads where no other show ever has, it's full of twists and it lulls you into a false sense of security before stabbing you in the back. You really have no idea what will happen, and it's the unpredictability combined with the shear boldness that makes this show so much better that any other. Where other shows have main characters that you know won't die because that would be the end of the show, Game of Thrones doesn't have any one main character. So they could do anything."
68,"I have read the books (the first three I have read twice, the fourth once). I love the books. So in theory I am pre-disposed to either like the series or hate it because it is not sufficiently like the books. It would be damn near impossible for me to judge the series as if I had not read the books. I have only seen the first two episodes of the series.

All that said, I love the series. The casting is phenomenal. The acting better than some of the best mini-series. Tyrion is spot on (a phenomenal acting job and a phenomenal character). Jon Snow is spot on. Arya Stark, Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister etc, etc. The series clearly gives the feel for the book and is true in its characterizations. No series will have every plot detail of a book nor will it have every character exactly as every individual sees him/her, it can't, but this series is very true to the book, true to Martin's writing and true to the character of each player. I can't wait for the next episode. I want to own the series on DVD (Blu ray). I want to go back and read the books.

This Series is a must see in my book."
69,"I have read most of the reviews and find it staggering to read some of the negative rubbish posted by people in regards to the offensive and deborturous scenes in this series. this is set in a time similar to the dark ages where they didn't have people to sensure every bloody thing they did and the show portrays this beautifully. read the books, they are full of bad language, violence and sex and the series is true to the books. this may come as a shock, but some of us don't like toned-down, sterile, politicly correct, lets-all-play-nicely harry potter rubbish we actually like to be taken to a world that is realistic of the period in time. its a world of under-handedness, violence, war-mongering and social turbulence and to make it feel realistic these scenes are required. i mean seriously, do you think manners and correctness was a requirement in the setting? if bad guys all spoke nicely and no one got the odd dagger in the eye and the whores god forbid didn't show the odd bit of tit would the viewer really find that realistic? instead, what we get is an in-your-face no holds-barred series that is true to the book. for those of you that find the sex scenes a ""ratings grab"" i suggest you read the book and you will find many pages filled with descriptive sex scenes. HBO is simply being true to the books. for those of you who have a problem with the violence, ITS SET IN A BLOODY TIME OF WAR! what do you think is going to happen if you joust against a sadistic 7ft tall giant? your going to get a lance in the neck is what! to sensure it would be to kill it by taking away the realism. to those of you that find all this too confronting i say take a step out of your sterile plastic bubble full of pixies and and cute little bunnies and other assorted non-confronting, politically correct cuddley things and change the frigging channel!!"
70,"Besides the very interesting and complex story the landscape is fantastic, the costumes impressing and detailed. The actors are first rate and the story is not for the faint of heart. Definitely no children's book! The special effects are very good for a TV show and they don't overdo it. I never saw anything like it and I'm glad that for once I did not read the books first, which can be a bummer if you have a vivid imagination and the director has a different one. The High Definition makes every detail stand out beautifully, even too detailed for some scenes. For example the little girl's rapier, named 'Needle' has a clearly visible round security tip at the supposedly pointy end, which is the only complaint I have.:-)"
71,"Yes, this is my favorite TVShow, and i have seen a lot of series such as Lost, Breaking Bad, White Collar, Greys Anatomy and many others, but still this is my favorite one. No i have not read the books but my cousin have told me that's the same thing. I love Game of Thrones because of it's story, the scenarios, the actors, the visual effects. I mean this series has everything anyone could love of any TV Show. The story at first is a little bit strange and you may not get anything but after at leas t5 episodes of the first season you know very good the story and how is it going. And if you relate with a specific character it may be killed, yes in this tvshow many main character got killed but i think this makes the series more special, it's completely different to other shows when the main character never gets killed. The custome its another thing that makes game of thrones very special, its absolutely awesome and perfect, again, even more than other series such as lost or NCIS. I can't simply wait for more of this series."
72,"I never read the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series, so maybe my unbiased opinion can be of use.

From what I've seen from the TV show (2 episodes), I can assure you it's up to HBO's high standards.

The fantasy elements are minimal in the first episodes, with only the chilling opener and some dragon eggs that seem not entirely dead ;) So what we now essentially have is a dark medieval tale. I'm wondering how they will roll out these elements in the next episodes.

The atmosphere is extremely grim to American standards and the storyline will grab you by the throat from the very first scene.

It has complex characters, all with their own agenda, which you just can't label ""good"" or ""evil"". They behave like normal people would. It is totally believable. No formulaic ""comic relief"" , no ""cute"" characters... How confusing this must be for some people :-) This is a series that doesn't threat its viewers as children and entirely lives up to the hype.

An excellent job, HBO"
73,"This Last season has been nothing but negativity.

One episode after another, just downers. Or plain boring.

I don't get any joy or excitement from watching Game of Thrones anymore. I just feel crappy.

I'll probably watch the next episode, but I'm not looking forward to it. And it will probably be when I don't have anything else to watch.

Game of thrones was a great series to watch before. Now it just seems like it's going out of it's way to try to shock, instead of entertain.

So... if this is how it's going to be from now on. Then I'll probably move on to other things to watch."
74,"Game of Thrones is the type of show in which you watch the first few episodes, and you are bored. But if you continue, and watch a whole season. You will love the show with such an intense passion that only GOT viewers can love. With it's intense intrigue, mind blowing plot twists, amazing acting, great makeup, a huge budget. It literally is the show to impress. Granted it may get a little every once in a while, but only for like a few minutes. Every minute is gold, and it only has the fans wishing it had more than 10 episodes per season. A huge GOT fan myself.. I can testify to the authenticity of this masterpiece. Not a show for children."
75,"The first thing you need when making a television series on this scale is a very good story. George Martin wrote and continues to write a magnificent story that in many ways is on a scale similar to Lord of the Rings. It is more than just a fantasy adventure, it is an entire world, full of different cultures, languages and history and everything that comes from it, good and bad.

What makes the television show so good is that it follows the story closely, deviating only when it must to suit the audience needs and visual requirements. No matter how good a television show is, the viewers imagination is less engaged than a readers and therefore must be served sometimes a little more blatantly.

The story is in a way simple, even with a few separate areas of intrigue slowly converging, but the characters, their history, their reasons, they are complex and as such you can't just tune in and expect to be rolled along from battle to battle with the hero saving the day and winning the girl.

In my opinion to truly enjoy this you need to have read at least the first book if not all of them so far. The books build the world in a way that it is difficult for a television series or film to do. The detail combined with time and your imagination are what makes it so impressive.

The negative comments I've seen here all appear to stem from that very issue. No plot they say, yet there are many and they are so realistic it's fascinating. Too much sex and gore, yet this is a medieval setting, a very real and not so distant past should tell us that life in those times and places was often grim and usually short. I even saw one who scored it 1 out of 10 and opened with ""I don't like fantasy stuff"" which reminded me neatly not to have the omelette for lunch as I don't like eggs.

Read the books - watch the show. But pay attention. Life is interesting because of the little things, the details, the nuances. That as much as the visual effects and scenes is what makes this a television masterpiece."
76,"I have not had the pleasure of reading the books however, it seems that the series sticks close to them according to other reviews. It can seem drawn out in some episodes but with so much to cover I can see the challenges. Overall it is a stunning masterpiece with something to grab your attention each episode. I love how the opening sequence is somewhat interactive in that it keeps up with what is going on in the story line. For me, it is the best opening sequence in a long time. If you love fantasy and I am a big fan of fantasy, you couldn't ask for more. Well, maybe just to see those awesome dragons fully grown finally! I can't wait, what a spectacular series."
77,"As the summary states, do yourself a favor and do NOT watch this ""TV show."" What I mean by this is that Game of Thrones will spoil you to the point of making you sick. Nothing else you watch, on television or otherwise, will provide the gut-wrenching, tear- jerking, soul shattering moments that Game of Thrones causes one to feel on a regular basis. Many of the emotions you experience are simply indescribable. As you watch it, it is akin riding your first roller coaster. The way that first hill makes you realize with dread that you are at the mercy of a beast; the plunge that follows, causing your insides to rise from your stomach to your throat; the countless twists and turns which momentarily lull you into a false sense of safety before jerking your body in a new direction; and, finally, when the ride is over and you struggle to regain your composure, staggering uncontrollably to return to reality's homeostasis. As an avid Braveheart/Gladiator/Saving Private Ryan movie buff, this show easily rises to those levels. And, in some ways, because it is essentially a multi-hour cinema experience, Game of Thrones surpasses them in theatric quality. Like I said, please don't watch the show. It makes you wonder all over again which rock Mel Gibson, Ridley Scott, and Steven Spielberg are hiding under."
78,"Ever since the first book was released in 1996, I have been an ardent fan of the Song of Ice and Fire books by George R. R. Martin; the series is one of the best fantasy novel series ever written in my opinion. As such, I have eagerly anticipated the TV adaptation of the books. Now that season one has finished, I feel I am able to give a complete and fair review of this show.

Season one of Game of Thrones does an excellent job of staying true to the first book of Martin's series named, not surprisingly, Game of Thrones. The plot of this book revolves around three major story lines: the political tensions on the continent of Westeros that eventually lead to a conflict known as the War of the Five Kings, the exiled princess Daenerys Targaryen who plots to reclaim the rule of Westeros that her family has ruled for nearly the last 300 years until Robert's Rebellion (yes, the same King Robert Baratheon in the show), and the awakening of an ancient evil known as the Others in the north beyond the Wall.

The show aptly captures the essence of each of these three story lines, tying them together cleverly so that the audience sees how each of these three threads are being woven into one overarching plot. Given that even 10 hours worth of material is not nearly enough to tell the full story in the book version of Game of Thrones, the writers of the show should be applauded for brilliantly transferring to the small screen all of the foreshadowing, character motivations and personalities, cultures, drama, politics, and emotion of the book.

The acting is top notch. Nearly every actor brilliantly portrays their characters just as they are portrayed in the books. It is worth watching these episodes over and over again just to see their performances. Even the children actors do a fantastic job. The sets and costume designs are also very well done - I wonder if there was any collaboration with those who worked on The Tudors, a somewhat similar series on HBO that reminds me of this show in terms of set and costume designs.

Now on to the parts of the show that I felt like were disappointing. Even though HBO apparently sunk nearly five million dollars into each episode, the show still felt low budget. Perhaps the most disappointing part of the show was the fact that most of the action scenes from the book were either emitted or harshly truncated in the show. The choreography of the few action scenes that were in the show were mediocre, I felt. Given that the story largely revolves around a war, it is a bit silly to not even attempt to show any of the battles in this war. Budget constraints are no excuse - the History Channel does a fine job of portraying epic historical battles using almost no budget at all.

Some other rather disappointing facets of the show that reeked of low budget was the fact that nearly every scene was a scaled down version of the scene from the book (save for the end of episode 9 - now THAT was brilliantly executed). For example, Khal Drogo's khalasar is a horde that consists of about forty thousand warriors alone, and yet no more than about 10-15 are shown at any one time. The result is that the viewer never really realizes how powerful Khal Drogo is and why Daenarys is such an important character. HBO could have used a little bit of creative CGI to easily show the true scope of many scenes from the book. The direwolves were also conspicuously absent throughout the show. In the book, they played a much larger role. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised with the CGI in the final scene of the final episode, however. Now why couldn't such CGI have been used for the direwolves? Budget constraints, I know, but come on, HBO had five million dollars to work with per episode - that's not exactly a shoestring budget (though admittedly, not such a large budget either - consider many one and half hour movies have cost over 100 million dollars to make).

Another complaint I have with the show was some of the unnecessary sex sequences. Given the gritty realness of the books, it was certainly necessary to show sex and violence in the show to adequately capture the mood of the books. However, HBO went way overboard here. Given that it's important to squeeze as much plot as possible into every episode, unnecessary and extraneous sexual sequences serve absolutely no purpose other than to mollify desperate and horny teenage boys, and in fact cheapen the importance of the main story lines. I had the same complaint with HBO's The Tudors as well.

So overall, this show did an excellent job, with some glaring exceptions. To sum up...

PROS: Excellent acting, excellent portrayal of the plot, mood, and characters from the book, excellent sets and costume design

CONS: Flagrant lack of action sequences, including failing to show battles in a story that revolves around a war, scaled down scope of many scenes, the direwolves didn't get the screen time they deserved, and unnecessary sex scenes."
79,"When I have free time and look to be entertained, I seldom reach for a book or engage in the arduous task of reading through an expansive novel. So for me, whether or not Game of Thrones remains true to its original roots factors little when it comes to the entertainment value of a movie or television production.

When it comes to cinematic entertainment, I want to be fully engaged in the story and characters presented on screen. I want to be surprised and kept on the edge of my seat by clever writing that makes the unpredictable twists and turns of a story plot actually make sense. Actors, whose craft is so convincing, that whether you love or hate the characters they portray, they passionately inspire you to feel something even if you find yourself shouting at the screen like a complete buffoon as if watching some sporting event. And, if left biting my nails at the end of each episode in anticipation for the following week's program --- I'll gladly pay the extra monthly fee to HBO just for the privilege!

Game of Thrones, in my humble opinion, is all that and more. In regard to overall quality, I find it even surpasses the majority of expensive movie productions being released in local theaters. While I'm hardly a professional critic, history expert or avid reader of fiction novels --- I AM a happy and passionate fan of this superb HBO series and simply wish to add my sincerely applause to the cast and crew that made this HBO production the enormous success that it is. Thank you!"
80,"Lord of the Rings it ain't... and I mean that most definitely as a compliment to Game of Thrones. Don't get me wrong, I liked Lord of the Rings, but the 'Seven Kingdoms' of Game of Thrones is a spectacularly unpleasant place to live, as any show set in what is essentially the Middle Ages should be. If you find subject matter such as extreme violence, bad language, rape, incest and just generally very unpleasant behaviour unpalatable, maybe give it a miss. It's an HBO 12th century thing with, so far, mild supernatural elements. Two and a Half Men it is not.

Sean Bean plays Eddard Stark, the main character and puts in a solid performance, for the moment, never sure how long anyone is going to live in this show. I was always quite fond of the guy, this is by far his beast work to date. Also a shout out to Peter Dinklage, who has the somewhat depressing honour (for all other ""dwarfs"") of being the first ""Dwarf"" to receive a decent roll in a film that doesn't mock him. Quite the opposite in fact, he plays an intelligent, womanizing, cunning and witty person who so far is, in my opinion, the most likable, and it has absolutely nothing to do with 'Aww he's a ""dwarf"" and he's just like us', nah, he's an incredible actor that plays his role with utter class and completely convincingly, and after two episodes was able to make me forget about the brainwashing that Hollywood has inflicted on most people about, and I don't even know what is the politically correct way to say it, so ""dwarfs"". I apologize to Peter Dinklage if I got that wrong.

There are a considerable number of important characters in GOT and at times it can get a little confusing, but you have to stick with it, it's worth it, and you DEFINITELY have to watch it from the beginning. If I missed an episode I'd be totally lost.

The investment in everything from costumes to CGI has in no way been short changed, HBO pulled out all the stops on this one, which, I hope, means they're not going to just drop it (at least without giving it some kind of ending, as they DIDN'T with OZ for example).

This is my first review, I'm aware it might not be great, but if you have a thick skin and can handle unpleasant content, then this show is definitely worth watching, but again, start from the beginning and watch as intended, don't try to ""cheat"", you'll only cheat yourself.

This and The Walking Dead are the best TV shows currently on TV, but this, so far in my opinion, still has the crown.

9/10"
81,This is the most Overrated Show Ever. The Fact that this show sits at top in top TV charts prove lack of intelligence in people now days. This show hacked perception of people that everyone saying its good that when you watch it you can't think for yourself and you agree with other people.
82,"While I'd heard of Martin and his work, I came to the series not having read the books. The show so far has lived up to my expectations with a well-assembled cast and the budget to explore the visual depth of a richly-drawn mythos. It is an HBO production and as such nudity and unflinching portrayal of more brutal aspects of their lives was to be expected. People in early history were much more intimately acquainted (no pun intended) with sex, bodily functions and death than many sanitized accounts would lead us to believe, so I find it adds an earthy realness to the story rather than distracting from it as gratuitous. Looking forward to the rest of the season!"
83,This is the greatest show ever and beats out every other show. This is the show that a person should start on first.
84,"Stating that this show is going to be remembered as one of the best television shows in history is a bold statement, but in this case it is true.

All I will say is that the acting is great, characters are not simply good or bad, the setting looks real, and the budget for the upcoming season is larger than most movies.

My recommendation is that you should watch it and enjoy the ride."
85,BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST!!! BEST SHOW EVER MUST WATCH
86,"I Am A Huge Of This Series ,I Haven't Read The Books It Is Based On,So All You Will Hear From Are About The Series Itself and NO It's Comparation To The Books I Have Watched All The 7 Seasons and OH BOY This Constantly Keeps Improve and so the 6th and 7th Season are Trully Excellent (They Have Some flaws ,as the other seasons and ALL the Rest Of The TV Shows ,but that really doesn't matter because by the time that every episode starts you are trully sucked in the world of Westeros and you care for NOTHING else ,or it's just me) Specifically, The Acting is nothing less than EXCELLENT,especially from Lena Headey, Peter Dinclage,Sean Bean(in his short lived time), Charles Dance, Emilia Clarke and (last but not least) Kit Harrington The Characters are trully unique and make you either vote for them and support their claims or love to hate them ( Joffrey and Ramsey). I personally have a very hard time to vote for stricktly one of them because they are so different between them and ,ever for the ''villains'' their motives and perspectives are so well explained that it hard not to feel them to The CGI is OUTSTANDING (especially for a TV Series) on Such Level That Is Ever Better than Lot of the Big Budget Movies.Even from Season 1 you can clearly see that this in NOT cheap to make The Story is (as you would expected) AMAZING and Captivating on Such Level That ONLY Lord Of The Rings Can Reach it But,If You Have Decided to watch tis Show ,which i hugely recommend you, beware that there is A LOT violence and nudity Other that GO WATCH IT and you can thank me later This Is my First Review,so don't be too hard on me,Last Information, I CAN'T fully express how much i love this, but i can say to you that this is the reason i Love TV and start waching TV shows and DON'T BELIEVE anyone that gives this series less than 7 stars, because either he doesn't appreciate the genre or he is just stupid 10/10 (along with the LOTR the best fantasy ever)"
87,"This is a violently graphic and strong retelling about facing off among various families in an undetermined time . Nine noble families battle for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) , King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard ¨Ned¨(Sean Bean), Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. When Ned returned to Winterfell at the end of Robert's Rebellion, he had a bastard son, Jon Snow, by an unknown woman he had met in the South. He raised Jon alongside his five trueborn children Robb (Richard Madden) , Sansa (Sophie Turner) , Arya (Maisie Williams) , Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) , and Rickon (Art Parkinson) . Along with the Stark family is Theon (Alfie Allen), he became a ward of Lord Eddard ""Ned"" Stark at Winterfell, and he became close with Robb . Although Ned is secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further . Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power . There appears Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) the third and youngest son of Lord Tywin (Charles Dance) and Lady Joanna Lannister. Because of his unusual stature Tyrion has been a victim of mockery his entire life, with people overlooking his noble birth in order to tease and taunt him. Tyrion's mother died giving birth to him and his father and older sister Cersei (Lena Headey) have despised him all his life as a result. He has always maintained a close relationship with his elder brother Ser Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), Cersei's twin . Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne . As Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) is the only daughter of Aerys II Targaryen and Rhaella Targaryen , she is now a princess living in exile, the last of the Targaryens . But Daenerys grows into a supremely confident warrior women with perhaps the most stringent code of ethics in all the Seven Kingdoms. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond . There finds Jon Snow (Kit Harington) , the bastard Son of Lord Ned Stark by an unknown mother , it is here that the skills that were passed on to him by Ned come to light as Jon becomes a natural born leader with a strong code of ethics and an effective warrior when battling at and beyond the Wall.

This is a spectacular epic dealing with friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn,Tyrell and Martell and in which political and sexual intrigue is pervasive ; all of them lead to full-scale war . Breathtaking epic version based on George RR Martin novels with exciting drama and overwhelming combats , his stories are imaginatively brought to life on groundbreaking images with great production values and outstanding scenarios . Sword cross , intense drama , nudism , sexual scenes , and bloody fights abound in this spellbinding adaptation . Magnificent climatic battle scenes and struggles including lots of blood and gore ; and adding colorful computer generator images including heinous dragons . The series is well written by an excellent plethora of screenwriters as David Benioff , D.B. Weiss , Vanessa Taylor under supervision by the great creator George R.R. Martin . This author was asked if he had a resolution or ending to the seemingly endless conflict , he replied that the end would be a cloud of dust or snow being driven by the wind across a vast graveyard full of tombstones. The series takes its name from the first novel in the book series ""A Game of Thrones"" - which is actually known as ""A Song of Ice and Fire"",and most of the show is largely faithful to the books . George R.R. Martin's story credit acknowledges the entire series under this title, rather than the title of individual volumes. George R.R. Martin has stated that the infamous ""Red Wedding"" was the hardest chapter for him to write in ""A Storm of Swords."" He was so emotionally attached to the characters that he actually wrote the rest of the book first, and then that chapter last ."
88,"The show is one of a kind and will not be duplicated or supplanted. The books are generally a great read, and the show gets consistently more out of all the actors than any show I've seen of late.

This isn't the typical American ""Happy Ending"" nonsense. Bad things happen to good people in Game of Thrones. That's part of the beauty of Game of Thrones, your feelings aren't spared in the least. The series will break your heart, shake you up and leave you disillusioned. Once you become immersed in the story and allow yourself to feel for the characters there's no turning back regardless of what happens.

I've ready all the books, will own all the DVDs. I'm completely captivated no matter how mad they make me! For me, there's the Game Of Thrones and then there's everything else."
89,"Fantasy is not a genre I usually on well with. S03E09 'The Rains of Castamere' caused so much uproar on the internet that it was hard not to intrigue me.

I gave the show a second chance, it took a while for me to think it as more than mediocre (I think this was because it takes a while to learn who everyone is and what they are related to / trying to achieve in the show - it's a big cast), but when I did, oh god, did the TV shock me.

There's a few moments where your jaw will drop. but after a while - the mistreatment of characters becomes second nature, despite this, this show still finds way to cause dismay.

The end of Season 1 with Jason Momoas' character, the beginning of Season 2 (with the babies), oh and let's not forget S03E09. I mean, holy s*** - what happened. It's just. I'm not going to give an explanation about this episode, or this show because, one didn't sell it for me. It's very popular. it has comical and witty dialogue. There are so many story-lines and characters, intertwining to satisfy your thirst. Fabulous TV. Peter Dinklage was my favourite part about the show in episode 1 and that is still the case at the end of the 3rd Season. Daenerys a close second. She's 'bad*ss'. I'm still thinking about that episode. Roll on S04!"
90,This is so good that I don't think I will be able to enjoy other shows. Excellent
91,"A cult series.Political intrigue, character development and character conflict. A must watch."
92,"Best Tv series i had ever seen. But one problem is nudity. I've to watch GOT without my Family members.

""Winter is Coming"""
93,"I don't think there will be a show as good as this for a very very very Long time , GOT is the only series have watched all season over and over again it so addictive as soon as I finish I start all over from season one it that damn good!! No other series or movies even come close to how incredible the show is ."
94,"Human irrationality became a subject of much research in the late 20th century. Some of these researchers have already received the Nobel Prize. George Martin captured this Zeitgeist and developed his literary plot, in A Song of Ice and Fire based on irrational behavior. His fantasy novels develop from the relative rationality of characters to absolute irrationality of characters, including story lines and ambience. However, if one remembers Tolkien's Fantasy Universe, his Universe develops from irrationality to rationality (perfectly matched with the history of Renaissance). In the mid 20th century, one sees the peak of Sci-Fi literature. As a result of this, - we see the development in techniques and engineering resulting in the of creation bombs, and the discovery of new sources of energy and etc.). So, irrational realities became a focal point of literature, not only academic, but fictional as well. At the same time, TV series production brought a new wave of literature, revitalizing some literary traditions (also here is a good example of Big Little Lies by Liane Moriarty). TV series have made available some literary characters and unread stories to a wider range of people, non circumscribed by national borders, ethnicity or other factors. The Game of Thrones, based on the works George Martin, is a useful TV series which discovered the limits of irrationality human and non-human beings."
95,The best tv series ever created i also read the book.
96,"I had heard nothing but good things about Game of Thrones when my boyfriend and I picked up the first season; as such, I had high expectations. I was not disappointed—if anything, my expectations were not high enough. Starting in the evening, we intended to watch ""just a couple of episodes."" Hours later, as the sun was coming up, we were still glued to the TV. We watched the entire series in just two days. This is easily one of the best acted and best written shows that I have ever watched!

Imagine my further enthusiasm upon discovering that it was based on a book series. Being an avid reader,I picked up the first book in the series A Song of Fire and Ice (which shares the name of the show) at my earliest opportunity. As much as I loved the show, I absolutely expected it to be much different from the book; as an avid reader, I am also aware of how badly most movies and TV shows manage to foul up when making the transition from the written page.

I could not have been more wrong. This show follows the book so closely that there are even whole sentences of dialogue that must have been copied directly from the book into the show's script. The few differences are so minute as to not really matter; most of them actually add to the show, rather than being detrimental. In addition, the casting is fantastic. Having seen the show first, I worried that the appearance of the actors might color the way I viewed in the characters in the book; this was not the case. Although I did, in fact, picture the actors in most cases, it was only because their resemblance to their fictional counterparts had been so closely adhered to in the television adaptation. With so many characters involved in the book's story, one might assume that some of them would have been left on the cutting room floor when the series went to wrap . . . but, as I mentioned, the amazing adaptation included every plot point, no matter how small of a part a character may have. This is good news, as I have seen far too many movies and shows that ignore a supporting character in early episodes only to have the character become a major player later on, leaving a plot hole in the early episodes and people wondering, ""Hm, where did this guy come in?""

I have not had a chance to begin the second book yet, although after finishing the first one, I immediately went out and bought the rest of the series. As excited as I am about reading the next book, it is with even greater anticipation that I wait for the return of this amazing series. I would recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy genre. Truly,I would recommend this show to anyone!! If you are looking for something to watch that is visually and intellectually captivating,incredibly acted and well written, and fun to boot-- or just an entertaining bit of TV to get you through a rainy day-- then you have found it in Game of Thrones!!"
97,"Game of thrones can't truly be placed into any specific category due to its incredibly organic stile of story telling.

When you watch movies, such as lord of the rings or the hobbit(yes I understand that they are both Tolkienian), you know which characters have got ""invisible plot shields"" which make them impervious the lethal danger, yes Frodo gets stabbed and poisoned by the Morgul-Blade but that all works out for him fine in the end.

In game of thrones characters are treated as people and don't get give these mysterious powers to evade death by pure fluke. You will form emotional bonds with the characters and each time a character is killed of it just makes you become more and more connected with the Game Of Thrones Universe.

Game Of Thrones also probably has some of the strongest characters in books and movies alike because you can really elaborate on you feelings about a character and 2 people may have interpreted a characters actions differently depending on the persons outlook.

This is a very mature show and should be treated as such so if you just want something at and listen to as your eyes glaze over while playing a video game or reading a book then this is not for you. In order to really appreciate the depth of the series you need to pay attention to the context because if you miss a bit you may loose track of the entire series or even show as a whole.

The only thing which I can say that some users may not like is the large amount of graphic sex and nudity in the series, but that isn't anything to demote it for, just be warned not to watch it in front of children.

To conclude, game of thrones is a fantastic TV show if you are watching it and not just using it for white noise. I would wholeheartedly recommend game of thrones as long as you are mature and over the age of 14."
98,"This is the best thing on telly at the moment!!

Watched the first episode without knowing anything. Doesn't give anything away but certainly sets the setting. The whole package is brilliant. From the opening credits, to the marvellous acting from young and old characters alike. I must admit I am not too keen on British films or dramas but a majority of the cast are British but they do a sterling job.

Each episode invites the viewer into this mysterious world where power,love, magic, deceit,honour and much more all intertwine.

What really makes this show are the characters. There are so many unique characters in their own way - their parts have been played so convincingly and they essentially make the show.Hate them or love them you will certainly appreciate quality performances from this cast.

Only criticism is Season 3 doesn't quite live upto the other two - and of you are lucky enough to have not watched them already - watch the episodes consecutively --you'll be so hooked you wont have the choice."
99,"""Game Of Thrones"" is becoming one of a legendary TV Show because of its Perfection

Story, Direction and Acting are just quite Marvelous and accurate, each episode have something entertaining to show, I would like to say that an hour wasting of watching ""Game of Thrones"" is not a quite wasting,Because You can't realize how smoothly this hour passes. Story Line is just Wonderful and unique. People are trying to compare it with ""Lords of the Ring"" But trust me, Here's no Comparison. As ""Lord Of the Rings"" was Legendary On Big Screen, In the same Manner ""Game Of Thrones"" is becoming Legendary on Small Screen, Only Two seasons have shown Quite things. Sometimes it seems now what is left to make? But as New Episode releases,prevails entertainment more and more."
100,"I cannot, I repeat CANNOT be bothered with elves, hobbits, etc, etc.

But here, I found a world of medieval machinations underpinned with supernatural and mythical background that grips then twists then keeps you on the drip like the most powerful narcotic.

I have never read the books but will pick up the second in the series for this is exactly the pitch I like my 'fantasy'- rooted in semi-realism, great characters, carousing plot, plenty of adult material - and I mean the language, the intrigue, not just the copious nudity - to get one's teeth into.

Notable acting mentions to the tour de force that was Sean Bean and the comic depth of Peter Dinklage - superb delivery that made every episode for me.

Take it from a 'hobbit-hater' - this is the anti-Tolkien and the way forward, fantasy without the twee and cheese.

A brilliant watch.

9/10.

-1 for being only 10 episodes long. Cold turkey until next spring :("
101,"I'm not much of a TV show fan. And while I recognize the greatness of recent dramas like breaking bad, mad men or house of cards, it is very difficult to get so invested in the characters there, and I don't think i've ever waited anxiously for the next episode. And that, is what Game of Thrones does better than any other series, it makes you care for the characters, and it keeps you waiting for the next episode. Game of Thrones isn't the best TV show out there, that honor would probably go to The Wire, but it is shocking that despite not even being held in our world, it is far more fascinating.

The best thing about this show is it's unsurpassable depth, especially in seasons 2 and 3, which have focused more on the characters. Personally, I used to watch this show casually, and skipped the parts I didn't like while asking my friend to remind me what was happening. It is massive and it's hard to keep track of everyone, and so a casual viewer might not agree with my statement of depth. As a casual viewer, I thought so too at first. I didn't like the talkative season 2, or even the beginning of season 3, as the show slowed down there.

But during a very boring summer I decided to invest more in the series. I went to a wiki and read the characters backstories, watched every episode again and then read through the first two books. The more time i spent on the series, the more I noticed how deep the story is.

I also think, contrary to many other opinions, that the show is steadily improving, despite the fact that the plot is slowing down. It's focusing more on the characters, which is fine with me, considering that they are the most interesting ones out there. The Lannister males, Tyrion, Jamie and Tywin, in particular are some of the best characters in any show, ever.

The first season suffers from sexploitation, and second and third seasons have talkative episodes that aren't always interesting, so I'd give it a 9.5/10, but since that's not an option.. 10/10"
102,"To create a show as complicated and beautiful as Game of Thrones you need many ingredients. First you must add a dab of medieval England and Lord of the Rings. You then add a pinch of sex and nudity. 3 table spoons of war and violence, a whole bag of love, deception and revenge, you mix this with the lengths people will go for power and add a little dwarf and there you have it, the beautifully crafted show Game of Thrones!

The genius of Game of Thrones however is not all that I mentioned above but rather the characters. Everyone in the long list of complicated characters is so different yet all seem so real. The genius dwarf Tyrion, the honourable Eddard Stark and the cunning Littlefinger. All these characters hook you in so much that you in a way don't care about the main plot as long as they live. That is why I believe Game of Thrones is a must see."
103,"This adaptation (so far) is without a doubt the best I've ever seen. Few books ever make the transformation from script to screen without loosing something monstrously important to whomever has read it and taken it to heart. We can all reel them off. The Beach for me ... what a pity. But HBO really have pulled it out of the bag with Game of Thrones. The sets, characters and costumes are perfect, they've even kept huge segments of dialog exactly the same.

GoT almost plays out like a medieval polecat thriller, with a hint of fantasy. If you're after a Lord of the rings type saga, you're going to be disappointed, only until you realise the plot is so thick and rich, you'll be on Amazon 5 minutes later ordering the books to find out what happens next. I'm on book 3 and hand on heart, I think it's one of the best stories ever told.

I dare anyone not to enjoy this epic medieval drama."
104,"Well done writers, cast and crew. This is a brilliant adaptation of what is for me the best fantasy read I have ever had. Whilst some of the negative reviews have mentioned the vast array of characters and events in only the first few episodes, I on the other hand am amazed at just how well the massive amount of characters and descriptions have managed to be so well filtered or captured for TV. This is a massive undertaking and as someone who has read the book it is very difficult to judge just how understandable the plot is thus far if you haven't. This a tale of the human trait of tribalism, loyalty and betrayal set in the magical world created by a great author where seven kingdoms lie in constant fear of the evil that winter may bring and Winter is Coming. To understand the plot is to move in stealth from one land to another, one clan to another, one bed to another, weaving a thread that creates the patchwork of this intricate yet barbarically woven material. What I can say, is do not worry yourself too much about understanding who, what and where each character fits in, just watch it. You will become familiar with them as the story unfolds. That said, for those who have read the books, the series has had a lot to live up to and that is its biggest test, passed so far as far as this reader/watcher is concerned. I'm hooked, again and I'm loving it. The acting is readily acceptable if not very good and whilst I was anxious about the selection, I feel so far that every actor chosen has physically fit the character described in the book very well with the possible exception of Catelyn Stark played by Michelle Fairley (who should have been a little better looking) and John Snow played by Kit Harrington (although I can't quite put my finger on why). The detestable Tyrion Lannister, my favourite character, played brilliantly by Peter Drinklage is just perfect and as for Arya Stark (Maisie Williams), well they stole her right out of my imagination. I am writing this at episode 5 and may update it again at episode 10."
105,"Before I start, let me say that I watched the first two seasons without reading the books, but after season two I was interested enough to read all five novels before season three. In this way I have the perspective of both a watcher and a reader. The purpose of this review is to help people decide whether or not this show is for them.

A Game of Thrones (and the series of novels that it is based on) is somewhat unique in its story telling. Although it is a fantasy world, it is more based on our actual history than previous fantasy writings such as Lord of the Rings. It is also very dark, depicting many events that would have (and often did) take place in our own medieval time period. For these reasons, it is very difficult for some viewers to get into the series without previously reading the books.

After reading some of the more negative reviews here, I feel the need to clear up some of the main criticisms. There seem to be three major complaints:

1. It is too slow. Do not make the mistake of thinking that this is an action show. While there is a lot of fighting, it is often split up between a ton of politics, history, and character moments. This is a political drama, and the characters come first. I for one really enjoy the ""slower"" moments and find the dialogue just as interesting as the battles. If you like constant action and battle sequences, this is not a show for you.

2. Too much violence and sex. This show is not meant for the squeamish. It deals with many themes that are normally shied away from. The violence isn't constant, but when it arrives it is realistic and gruesome. The blood and gore is meant to emulate real injury and death in order to add realism. There is also a lot of nudity and sex. I will actually agree that the nudity sometimes goes overboard, but again, the show attempts to represent reality, and sex and nudity actually happens in real life (if you can believe it). If you cannot handle nudity and violence, this is not a show for you.

3. There are too many characters and plots to keep track of. Yes, there are hundreds of characters, spread out over two huge land masses, each with their own back story, motives, and positions. There is a history to the world that stretches back thousands of years, with epic events and battles. And there are many different kingdoms, all battling to better their own political position. It is not impossible to fallow (as some reviewers will have you believe), but it does require some time and patience to understand all of the people and the history. If you have trouble focusing, this is not a show for you.

If you got past these three major criticisms without second guessing yourself, and you like fantasy, there is no reason that you shouldn't like this show. Everything from the story, to music, to set pieces, to wardrobe, to acting and beyond, is top notch. It may take a few episodes to be fully immersed, but once your into the show its hard to get out! 10 out of 10."
106,"I'm not a huge fantasy fan, but I am a bit of a sucker for anything Brit-flavored and anything period, even if I can't always choke them down in the end. With historical productions, disappointment often comes with too many liberties taken with the facts. Literary adaptations suffer the same problem for those who have read the books.

I hadn't read the Martin books when I gave this series a try, so I had no expectations. However I was wary because Starz's Pillars of the Earth, which I also had no expectations for, turned out to be such an overwrought bag of cheese, full of bad writing and direction and what must have been a closeout purchase of chicken-bladder neck-blood- spurters. Then Camelot (also Starz) lost me in the first 20 minutes, and after that I had no stomach to even check out The Borgias after seeing what Showtime did with The Tudors. But with Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage, I thought Game of Thrones was worth a try, and it has been.

The production values are fantastic, and the acting and writing are very good, with only occasional forays into excess. The violence and gore are kept in context, although the sex and nudity are a little heavy-handed at times, probably as a safeguard in case the plot lines turned out to be too complex for some viewers. I found the story compelling enough to download ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" to my e-reader after watching a couple of episodes.

It's not a perfect creation, but it's very well done and as others have said, each episode makes you anxious for the next, and without the need for cliffhangers and sensational devices, just a desire to keep going. Bean and Dinklage are indeed both great as Ned Stark and Tyrion Lannister, and Mark Addy unfolds as an impressive and flawed King Robert. Having liked Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau in the short-lived New Amsterdam, it's good to see him back at work as the arrogant Jaime Lannister. Michelle Fairley is a formidable Catelyn, and Maisie Williams as young Arya Stark clearly has a great career ahead of her. In fact, most of the acting is solid-to-excellent. Sometimes the story line with the Targaryens and Dothrakis seems a little too over the top to match up with the very naturalistic feel of the rest of the series, but it's still interesting, and I look forward to seeing how it intersects with the rest of the tale.

Although it's not vital to the story, the opening sequence is beautifully done and worthy of mention.

HBO generally doesn't half-*** their projects, and they certainly didn't skimp on this one. Worth a watch."
107,"Just finished the first season. I'm usually not too interested in fantasy type shows or movies. I was a bit skeptical halfway through the first episode that it might not be for me, but now after I have finished the full season I would have to say that it is by far the greatest television show ever made! Across the board from set to performances, from story to production, this here is flawless television good friends! A single hour episode of this show will make any other show aired throughout the entire week look like complete joke... and they are. We desperately need more entertainment of this quality on our TVs!"
108,"This is by far the best show on TV now. Not even a close 2nd. With all the crap on TV these days, it's a nice little treat to get to watch this. The only problem I have with this show is that it only comes on 1ce a week and is not 3 hours long each episode.

I only started getting into it after the 3rd season bc i had lost all hope for television. The only reason I watched was bc a friend of mine has suggested it and told me to give it a chance. I feel like i owe him my life now.

If anyone says that this show is no good, they need to go back to watching tyler perry movies and just shoot themselves in the head after the binge watching them. Their opinions don't count and they should be banned from watching any good TV or giving any kind of review...ever."
109,"Game of Thrones is my absolute favorite series. It has everything you could want from a good series. Love, hate, joy, excitement, sadness and of course sex appeal. The actors fit their roles perfectly, and the roles perfectly in the story. The story is over time becoming more demanding and branches to dozens of people. The scenes are also incredible and win the heart of the viewer. For every Fantasy Fan Game of Thrones is simply required. With his history, his characters and his scenes of Game of Thrones is one of the best series ever. So I recommend everyone to buy the series, it sure is worth it.

,,Game of Thrones is an incredible experience"""
110,"I am not a fan of this genres or dramatic TV shows in general but after the recommendations of few friends and the IMDb user review rating for this show, I thought to myself, well, I should sit down and watch at least 1 episode and boy was I glad I did.

I went through 3 seasons in a couple of weeks and I am left speechless, blown away, hocked - more like addicted, crazily in love, and can't wait for season 4 to start.

While it is true that few actors, maybe one or two, are a little wooden in their acting range that did not put a dint in the overall experience watching this series.

By far and by any account and measurement this TV show is absolutely the best thing to ever make it on TV.

I just finished the third series last night so I am still shocked by you know what....."
111,"First of all let me say that I have never read the books and had no preconceived notions about this show before watching it. I was hearing and seeing buzz for ""Game of Thrones"" and decided to see what all the fuss was about.

I can't tell you how happy I am that I did! I don't know where to begin but let me start off by saying that this show has mass appeal. You would think that it would primarily catch the interest of fans of the book series or the same kind of geeky guys that are Lord of the Rings buffs. This is certainly true but once you get virtually anyone to watch an episode or two they will be hooked!

To make my point I will use my fiancée as an example. She has no interest in any kind of fantasy type movies involving sword fights, dragons and mystical lands. GOT certainly has plenty of those things in spades but what it also has, and ladies please don't hate on me because you know it's true, is a shitload of DRAMA! There are so many acts of betrayal and backstabbing you don't know which characters are frauds and which are trustworthy and honorable.

IMO the best thing that this show has going for it is it's cast of multi-dimensional characters. There are so many characters to follow, each of them unique, that it can become overwhelming at times. However, I would recommend that you don't grow too fond of anyone of the characters because in the crazy world of Game of Thrones anyone can be taken out at anytime!"
112,"I have been watching the tube since they were small, round and black & white back in the early '50s and Game of Thrones is the best production I have ever seen - by a wide margin. Everything about the show is off the charts from the writing and acting, to the sets, costumes and locations this show just plain keeps you on the edge of seat for the whole time you are watching. And, then you can't wait for the next episode. Fabulous storytelling a Tour de Force in the arts. This is must see TV and TV at its best. You used to have to go to the movies to an ""A"" movie at that to come anywhere close to the quality of Game of Thrones. This masterpiece of art touches the viewer's emotions in deep places and that is what great performing arts is all about. You either love of hate these characters who are brought to life so vividly by the actors and writers and directors. And, what is very interesting is you see the characters evolve before your eyes and your feelings toward them change as the tug and pull and rejection and revulsion work their way into your consciousness. Viewers feel passionately about Game of Thrones. I can't wait for next season."
113,"Cruel, bloody, vulgar, Machiavellian, unrepentant. And that is just the writing. The camera angles, the score, the pacing mesh together for grand storytelling: a mix of horror, swords and sorcery, and endless treachery.

And all of that would be somewhat squandered if it wasn't for the best casting I've ever seen. From Lena Headey as soft spoken Cersei to Peter Vaughan as ancient Maester Aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. Peter Dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; I've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery.

Can't wait for season 2."
114,"I wanted to wait with reviewing the series until I have seen at least a couple of episodes. Today I watched the second to last episode of the first season (episode 9). I am amazed and flabbergasted how incredibly brilliant this show is written, how amazing the actors act and the editing has been done.

When watching the first 5 minutes of episode one I already fell in love with it. It feels like you're watching a movie, rather than a series. Although if it had been a movie, it would not have been quite as much detailed as it could have been. Therefore the series are excellent in explaining the complete story.

I have not read the books myself (although it had been recommended to me several times over the past few years but I never got around to it. According to other people this stays very true to its original storyline.

You can expect gore and sex (elegant and not hardcore porn). Sometimes I would not advise to eat anything or to have a full stomach. It is a very raw storyline about the brutality of medieval times, combined with some fantasy. However in an interview with George R. R. Martin, the writer of the books he states that 'too much magic can ruin a story', and I completely agree. It is a brute, raw, painful and beautiful story to watch.

This is by far the best series I have ever seen and would probably be amongst the best movies I have ever seen."
115,"First of all entire credit goes to George R.R. Martin,D.B. Weiss and David Benioff for writing a wonderful script and then to directors and other departments worked for this show and kept in front of us. Generally i don't watch fantasy and drama genres but started to watch it then season begins between two royal families and kept on watching season by season that made me worth to watch its twists and waiting others to come.In this show every character has equal importance with a nice screenplay.Main theme song is nicely composed. After watching three seasons i can plot it in single line, main aim to capture the throne but having lot of depth involved mainly in betrayal. Be patient to watch the show then only it will be interest if not don't judge it by seeing two to three episodes. Till know there is no flaw in the show hope not will be in coming seasons also. Finally the series is simply fantastic."
116,"This is my first review ever and i am extremely glad it is for 'Game of Thrones'.In fact, this amazing and vivaciously plotted TV series made me register an IMDb a/c.

I am not much of a reader, as i tend to get bored just by looking at the thickness of books.I didn't even knew that the complete plot was derived from the Book series 'A Song of Ice and Fire' written by George R. R. Martin, until i finished the third season and learned that the next season will commence in 2014.

I will start the books just after completing this review, i can promise you that.

Before wrapping up, i would like to share with you all the stupid reason why i watched this series. It happened because of a PC game called 'SKYRIM ELDER SCROLLS V'. A friend of mine told me that there are surprising similarities between the two which i now find to be so crude.

I will also warn you not to judge the series just by watching the first few episodes cause you will miss so much fun-packed adventure and a blend of versatile characters that will be imprinted into your minds for lifetime.The dialogs are so awesome and highly intellectual that they imbibe you with wisdom and nourish your inner-self.My favorite so far is 'There is Power in a King's blood'.

******HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*****"
117,"I watched the first season before knowing anything about the storyline, and it sucked me in; it was totally incredible! Since then I've listened to 4 of the unabridged audiobooks in the series, all of which were EXTREMELY well done from my vast experience with audiobooks. I knew the storyline before season 2 began, yet I still couldn't wait for each new episode to air. Having read the books, the episodes helped to fill in bits I may have missed or misunderstood in the books, so the 2 mediums melded together nicely. This isn't a typical cliffhanger series with new stories written each week to fill a quota; it's a television adaption of the books which are gritty, ruthless, and are completely unpredictable in their turn of events, just the way you would expect things to be if this world actually existed. It stays within the story's boundaries given the limited time allowed for the series. Like the Lord of the Ring's, both film series are linear and tell the story, but both book series are more colorful with much more depth to the stories, more sidestories and character development than the time restrictions allow. I would recommend to anyone who likes the show even a little to read the books or listen to the audiobooks (Roy Dotrice really makes the characters in the book come to life!)."
118,"I must say that I've watched the complete first season in one day,and i wish there was more, because frankly, this has to be one of the strongest series out there. There isn't one character that i find boring, i care for every character and the story is built in a very slow way that is just amazing, giving you small bits by bits but in a way that is so well done that you are gonna be craving for more. Amongst all the character, i would have to say that Arya Arke and Daenerys Targaryen are my favorite characters, since they are two symbols of powerful and strong women who are slowly climbing to their true potential. Arya being a tomboy skilled with weapons and daenerys carrying dragon's blood.

Although it is a very well scripted and played out show, it is not for the faint of heart or depressive people, it is very grim, and at times hard to bear, but i find that in a sense it gives me hope that our race has made progress trough the year and that even if it is a ''fictional'' show, i imagine it is very resembling to medieval age. Therefore is why it fills me with relief to see that our time are much easier to live in, and it shows me that our situation is not bad at all, and that we have everything given to us. This show is very humbling in a way. There is also a lot of nudity and blood in the show so beware.

For those that make comment saying that it is too violent and there is too much nudity, i would reply : we were born creatures of sexuality, and we will die so. We are born naked and are taught to be ashamed of our bodies. I think this show brings us back to the base, the sexuality is shown in a very smart and useful way. As for the blood, well it is a show about war and hard times , surely you'd be stupid not to expect a lot of it. Got a problem with it? then don't watch it.

if you are wanting lord of the ring, this show is not gonna give it to you, it is a very realistic show with some few supernatural elements, there aren't mages with rods and hordes of orcs, so beware!

Anyways, a very amazing and beautiful show in every way."
119,"This show is MASTERFULLY produced, with a writer like GRRM that isn't a sell out you can be certain that plenty of respect is given to the books story lines. There are no mobs of angry book fans like so many other adaptations. The development of characters, the intertwining of plot lines, the acting, locations, wardrobe, set dressing- every hair on every head and every jewel on never neck is flawless. Just an absolutely captivating series. Here are my two wishes:

1) Ed Skrein to play Daario Naharis instead of the current vanilla dude 2) For me to never know of GOT until 10 years from now, so I can watch all 15 seasons in a row without waiting. Then die happily of malnutrition and skin ulcers. Yay :)"
120,"GAME OF THRONES is based on the novels A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, a fantasy series by American author George R. R. Martin. The series contains five books so far, two more will follow. The plot takes place in the mythical continent of Westeros, which is comparable with the European medieval. There are several powerful families or houses which are permanently fighting for the ""Iron Throne"" of Westeros. GAME OF THRONES combines epic adventures like in THE LORD OF THE RINGS with political intrigues and interpersonal issues like in THE SOPRANOS.

The actors are well chosen, most of them fulfill the image I personally had in mind when they were described in the books (unless they changed the outer appearance of some characters on purpose - for example one character has blue hair and a blue full beard in the novels, in the show the kept his outer appearance more usual). There is a huge amount of characters introduced, for non-readers the overview can be difficult to keep; That's why you always should pay attention, especially when new characters are being presented. The huge amount of characters does not lead to a chaos without any system, it all makes sense if you keep an overview.

Season 1 keeps as close to the novel as possible, when you read the book not long ago, you will even recall specific dialogues. In seasons 2 & 3, the HBO directors digress from the novels very slightly, but don't worry - the changes they made aren't really important, it's often just budget-forced; sometimes characters are left out or two characters occur as one.

When you hear about the show, many people say it's just about sex and killing one main character after another. Don't listen to this! Well, there is a lot of sex, but that's not what it's about. GAME OF THRONES shows how the European medieval could really have been - dirty, treacherous, dishonorable and inequitable. The point of killing main characters is true; George R. R. Martin is ruthless and does not care how beloved his characters are - when they need to die, they die. That doesn't mean, any death of a character is random, even if it seems this way at first. When the story goes on you will realize that every death has its purpose for the plot.

A major point that makes GAME OF THRONES one of the best books/shows in the past decades is the actualization of good and evil. There are only a few characters who are clearly considered as ""the good ones"" and even less, barely a handful of ""evil ones"". Every character has his own goals and achievements he wants to reach, just as ways to realize them. It's up to you if you support one specific character or not. There are many plot lines with different characters, some of them you will learn to love and some of them you will learn to hate.

If you enjoy the fantasy genres in general and are looking for a show full of tension, exciting plot twists and with an absorbing, really huge plot, then GAME OF THRONES is a must see!"
121,"Before I write a review I like to take a look at the ""Loved It/Hated It"". I do this before watching some movies/TV shows that I am uninformed or wary of wasting my time. I have to say I can't even remotely relate to what the ""Hated It"" folks are rambling on about. This series is well cast,(and a bit daring I think for casting Peter Dinklage (the dwarf) in one of the primary roles), he is excellent, you're not sure at the start of the series if your going to like or hate him but by the end of season 1, if you're anything like me, he has become one of your favorites. Lena Headey and Sean Bean are really the only actors that I was familiar with before watching GoT, but each character seems perfectly cast to me.

I did not watch this on HBO and therefore did not have to wait for weeks or months for the next installment, and thank goodness, once I started watching it was almost impossible for me not to go ahead and watch the next episode because the end of each episode left wanting more, and isn't that what a really good show should do.

I will say this, I was startled by this series in one way, they are not shy about killing off main characters in this show. I know that this is based on the series of books, A Song of Ice and Fire, I have not read them but I understand that they stay very true to the novels, but I would have found this just as startling for a novel, I won't spoil it for you by saying which characters but I will say steel yourself they come fairly often.

Because this is HBO there is a fair amount of nudity, sex and some fairly graphic violence, but I found none of it offensive nor gratuitous, but if that sort of thing bothers you it is the only reason I would say not to watch this series. I have watched all of the first 3 seasons and now can't wait till Season 4 begins, I hope you will enjoy these as much as I have."
122,"Being a huge fan of the books and a chronic cynic; I had many concerns when I heard they were making the series; how would they bring these books to film and do them justice. My largest concern was the difficult task the actors were handed. The books are written from the POV's of numerous characters; each chapter having a designated character. So you are inside the head of a character for all the events in the books. You learn the character's traits and motivations through his or her thoughts. This obviously cannot be done on film, so it comes down to the actors to portray what these characters are going through without the audience being able to hear their thoughts. I cannot name a single actor that fails at this. This cast is exceptional. Some notable shout outs go to the young members of the cast who are so essential to the story. Cudos to Jack Gleeson, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, and Isaac Hempstead Wright for pulling off Joffrey, Sansa, Arya, and Bran so successfully. Another shout out to Jason Momoa for Khal Drogo. When your character speaks a language created for the show; it becomes even more difficult to portray that character. Mr Momoa does it so successfully you want to stop reading the subtitles and watch him perform.

Another thing I was concerned about was the scope of the world and giving an accurate portrayal on film. There are so many descriptive locations in the books that needed to be shown to tell the stories. The locations were amazing. Most impressive to me were the Wall and The Eyrie; both whose features are not only difficult to portray; but vital to the story. The Sky Prison was just as I pictured.

My only critique is how difficult it is to take large book with a large cast and portray all the important details within the stories. I watched the series with my wife (who has not read the books) and at least once an episode had to explain some things that got glossed over. But over all an amazing vision of an amazing series of books. A must see."
123,"There is no word to explain my gratitude to the Directors and George Martin for not messing with the main story in the books and adapting the show right as it should be, no like the mokery named ""Legend of the Seeker"".

For newcomers, this show is unlike what you normally see on TV, much as the books are. Everything is so real and every decision and turn of events is like what could've happen if this story was in the real world.

Every episode is a great feast for the eyes and must be seen if you are a fan of fantasy series."
124,"This TV show is an amazing vortex of love, betrayal and gore. All of the violence is realistic and the sex/adult themes are handled maturely. I have watched ever since the first episode and it hooks and you in and keeps you watching. There are many characters, so, to hold attention, there are only a few characters focused on per season, and they are developed very well. You will find yourself loving or hating these characters and the acting is just incredible.

Each and every actor plays their part. This is a television masterpiece and should not be underestimated. If you are not a watcher, then you should begin watching and you will thank me personally - and find yourself siding with houses before you know it.

I cannot describe the magnificence of this show in a review, so you should watch it and have an opinion of your own. I, myself, do not understand why so much hatred goes toward this show, but I strongly disagree and hope that others who watch this series agree with my opinion.

In short, this TV series is magnificent and deserves every award that it has won and its rating of 9.4/10. It is worth the watch - definitely!"
125,"George RR Martin's A song of Fire and Ice is as epic and fantastic a series,set in the sword and sorcery mold as there ever has been. It's longer then the Lord of the Rings and five times as engrossing. The Game of Thrones TV Series is just as great. It's a grand story filled with heroics. Villainy and Magic of the darkest foulest kind. But unlike The Lord of the Rings. The Games of Thrones also has another edge. Politics,and family loyalities. Betrayal and manipulations that seem impulsive have resounding consequences. This is maybe one of the few shows on TV where actions have reactions The Walking dead is the other show where this has happened. For all of it's grandeur and glory. This is one of the only shows on TV Where it doesn't have any flaws. It's that good. OR if it does have flaws we're too busy having a good time to notice them. Subtle hints are tossed thru out the show as to what is going to happen. You just have to keep watching to see if you're right or wrong.

Imagination is king. And this show is full of imagination. It's full of the stuff that makes Legends. Each episode makes you want more. and the story carries you along relentlessly and mercilessly. You are caught in it's grasp. and you are going to thank God that you are. Because it's the best kind of trap to be caught in. Nothing is what it seems. And little things mean big things. And Evil walks the world some disguised as humans. Some disguised as monsters.

While Heroes look like ordinary people or look like monsters the only thing separating them is the actions of their hearts. And the Game of thrones plays on."
126,"I will first present to you my circumstances so that you can judge whether this review may accurately reflect your own opinion. After all, we read reviews so that we know whether to watch/read or not. So here goes; 23, read the books, enjoy fantasy, but hate it when fantasy fiction is turned into fairytale. Movies about the uglier side of humanity should be ugly. I also like sushi.

Now - the series.

It's ugly. And perfect. It is so wonderfully realistic, I'd say, that one's understanding of medieval life is altered forever.

While not breath-taking, the visuals are satisfying. Fantasy essentials such as the stone architecture and feudal attire are presented superbly. Action-scenes are kept short and precise and none of the gory details are left out. The prettier aspects of the film - some of which having read the book, I naively envisaged more gloriously - are done to perfection, even to the corny physical depiction of Jaime, whom in my opinion resembles Prince Charming from Shrek.

The principles of the series are also done very well. Barbarism and lust are portrayed very effectively. The nudity is not eye-candy, and much like the gore, it has you cringing at its vulgarity. Loyalty and friendship dominate the emotional landscape, as do their evil twins, betrayal and hatred. Most significantly however, the theme of family is put into the limelight and tested. All in all, feudal relationships and values are explored by the Game of Thrones to a level of quality only matched by the novels.

A quick word on the plot. Having seen only the inaugural episode, I cannot accurately gauge its whole quality, but having read the book, I can safely attest that if the series continues to present the story as faithfully as it has so far, it will leave the viewer breathless and deeply furious at the weekly nature of delivery of television viewing.

Perhaps the only thing not meeting the sublime standard of the whole, is the score. The music is dull, quite frankly. Perhaps in this aspect, the overly realistic nature of the series is damaging. I mean, sure, the barbaric Horselords are synonymous with tribal drum beats, but a guitar riff to emphasize their bad-assness could not have gone wrong, in my opinion.

In summary however, this series has made the perfect start. With some luck, and under the careful guidance of George RR Martin, it will hopefully continue on its epic journey in the same manner it has so far, awesomely."
127,"This show is in fact 3 disjointed story-lines ... that only come together at middle of season 7. The Story of Fire and the Story of Ice ... were merely used as devices ... to keep the audience buying the main story-line ... which was also the main focus of the show ... As for the main story of the show ... a medieval Game of Thrones ... we have only 3 major houses ... that actually impact the story ... with only Lannisters being allowed to move pieces on the game board ... the role of the other houses being only to react and counteract. While Lannisters are full featured by the writers ... strong military, best diplomats and schemers, filthy rich, best strategical position in the heart of Westeros, no taboos, the other houses are either too weak, too poor, too honorable, too divided. So the Lannisters always get on top ... even when their realm of possibilities is null ... something ... miraculous ... happens ... and they turn the table. At the end of season 7 ... the ruling power of House Lannisters ... from the beginning ... Cersei Lannister ... with the weakest position in the history of negotiations, and weakest poker-face ever, still manage to foul everybody ... this is how weak the writing of this show really is.

The show struggle from the beginning to foul the audience that it aims for realism ... so it obsessively promotes 3-4 anti-stereotypes usually found in history dramas and fantasy shows also introduce an insane amount of unnecessary and redundant characters ... so they can be killed afterwards ... following what they believe to be impressive and shocking visual effects. It is this lie ... which hooked a massive shallow and dull audience (TWD shared) to the show in the first place ... along with a massive marketing crusade ... unseen in any television show. Otherwise ... the show feature ... dragons, undead, resurrections, prophecies, visions, shadows and all the fantasy themed stuff ... running along (but not interacting) with an highly unrealistic medieval politics mechanic, aftermath and characters. It looks like it wants to be both ... but fails and it is none.

As far as the mechanic of Westeros ... and westerosi archetype ... i found an insane amount of contradictions ... despite being a patriarchal system (you will not see a female soldier, guard,...) ... it is 2 women that actually manage to make the ultimate power-play. In a world that is profoundly corrupt and limited to gold as ultimate value (which can be translated in sex and multiplication as the final goals) ... the westerosi ... manage somehow to summon ... a sacred respect for royal traditions, to acknowledge bloodlines and bent knees, be xenophobic and racist at the same time ... it is like the worst values the human races manage to uncover and promote ... in ten millenniums of written history ... no matter how contradictory ... the westerosi ... will have them ... all at once!

To resume ... GoT ... it is unrealistic, uninspiring, very slow paced, poorly written ... with contradictory rules ... which ultimately create a flawed world mechanic! The characters and their goals ... are predictable and simplistic. The story-lines are disjointed for 90% of the show time. The show struggle to be both fantasy and political medieval drama ... and fail at both counts."
128,"I know I am bit late to write the review but...

This show is damn awesome.

The location, the characters, the targeriyans, the king's road, the dragon egg's, the mad king, the loyal friend, the bastards, the dwarfs, the traitors, the plotters, the unholy lovers, the pet-wolves, the night's watch, the WALL, the blue eyed spirits of the haunted forest, the noob who becomes the king, the cunning lannisters, the prince with blonde hair, the tyranny surrounding the word Khal Drogo, the gulf of grief, the chameleon Baelish, and much much more!

I don't generally prefer TV shows because they run too long and the story keeps never ends. Luckily my friend recommended that since entire season 1 is out there, why not watch it all? Here's the twist, each episode is a master-piece.

I watched first episode, my mind blew-off in bewilderment of the 'pure' violence & love, the characters displayed to play the Game of Thrones.

The Baratheon King is a extremely cunning character, who never takes the center stage and yet remains purely in power. The Starks are the most lovable family with an unfathomable family pride. The all-powerful Lannisters, a family or kingdom in themselves. The bastard dwarf is one of best characters I have ever seen in any TV show. A character so tiny yet so powerful. Tyrion Lannister's dialogue delivery & portrayal of 'the bastards' is absolutely stunning. He is chatty and witty, probably the only Lannister without the trademark characteristics of a Lannister!

and I could go on and on about the other characters!

More than anything, all episodes remains absolutely loyal to the title, 'Game of Thrones'."
129,"I have now watched the first 3 episodes of what will maybe be known in the future as the Season 1 of the Game of Thrones TV mini-series - or, if fate would have it, the ""Game of Thrones"" season of the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series.

Yes, i do hope that all the books will be brought to life on the small screen, because the first episodes have been enjoyable to watch.

When I finished the last book of the series written so far, i felt.. sad. A truly wonderful experience had ended, and the words just stopped, never again forming into new adventures, but instead staying the same on the pages. But now, we are given a new, somewhat compressed, but nevertheless enjoyable way of reliving the story. With no changes to make it a different tale, but instead with something extra - a new dimension of faces, places and voices. Its a bit like looking through an old picture album with pictures from the good old days - the memories, the fantasy is your own, the pics are just there to help you remember. Only that in this case, all the pictures might not be exactly as you remember them..

Well, in my head, Ned was more noble-looking, Kings Landing never as sunny and Catelyn Stark younger. These self-made constructs are however fading and being replaced by the characters on the screen. Im willing to sacrifice that for the reward of enjoying the good old story one more time, anew.

And by the way, Tyrion is just perfect!"
130,"Well i've seen up to s01e02 and already i can see this is going to be passion filled character driven TV at its best. this is fantasy designed for adults not kids. the story seems complex and has more layers than an onion!

i'm glad its hbo doing this as they have the money to keep up the obvious high production values we've seen so far. hopefully they wont mess it up!

the cast seem perfect for the roles they are playing. sean bean and lena headly have the focus and passion to make this the best TV has to offer if the writers can pull it off. so much potential. already i'm feeling strong empathy for certain characters and my imagination is awash with ideas as to what will happen next.

i haven't described the story - read the IMDb description for that. these are my thoughts after the first couple of episodes."
131,"I watched GoT until the end of the 4th season. It's about nothing but soft porn and uncensored disgusting deaths. The story is much slower than by LotR (which is slow), and there are no great battle scenes which could make it better. There is just talking, sometimes sword fight, torturing, that's all, no one to empathize with, nothing to learn from, nothing exciting. Even watching ants is more fun (I guess). It is like a bubble, shiny, full of colors, but there is nothing inside, there is no value in it. I guess people who don't want to think, just watch, can really enjoy it. Good for them, but not for me. I decided not to waste my time with this series ever again. :-)"
132,"Murder. Hatred. Murder. Dragons. Murder. Nudity. Oh, did I mention murder? That's pretty much it. This is what this series is about. And I watched Season 1 and 2. It was horrible and I'll never get this time back. What's the matter with this generation? The hype surrounding this series scares me a lot. No sympathy at all, no memorable characters (because they all die right before they do or say anything memorable). The one and only thing I liked is the camera work. One of the saddest things is to see so many great and talented actors in this senseless series. I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed that this kind of series is so popular. A series without any morals, without any goal. It's just... Murder. Hatred. Murder. Dragons. Murder. Nudity. Oh, did I mentioned ..?"
133,"Reading the book you get into a really grim world. This did not happen in the first episode. To be honest, based on this series of book you should be able to cast a masterpiece in TV history. However, this did not happen. Hopefully the following episodes shall be more grim, as is the series of books, the ages and situations portrayed in those. There should be less focus on the graphics and more on the characters and acting to display the tough emotions and situations they are going through (Hint: make the actors read the books).

Nevertheless I am very happy that HBO is doing the series and being a fan of the books I shall be looking forward for the new episodes. Thank you for bringing this on screen."
134,"Never having read the books, and being pressured for months by my in-laws to see this, I had the very great pleasure of being able to watch the entire first season consecutively in one day.

By the time it finished, I was checking the date for the second season to start, hoping it was tomorrow. Sadly, I had to wait with the rest of the world.

My first experience of George RR Martin was back in the 80's with the Wild Cards series of books, which engrossed me with the way each character's story intertwined with the others, how events experienced from the perspective of one would be impacted upon others. To have many authors involved in developing separate characters each was a masterpiece of editing.

To have a sense of uncertainty about what might happen next is a difficult thing to bring to any story, with most plot lines having been subjected to a standard format and the characters being stamped out copies of the common stereotypes.

Martin seems to have brought a great part of that early concept of straying from the norm to this world, with the unexpected twists following a far more intriguing storyline than the average TV show, where the big names always make it to the end of the episode with all of their parts intact.

From Epic scale ideas, and subtle (and at times not so) hints at a rich past full of the best kind of myths, we begin to see the weave coming together on several levels. The way in which personality traits of characters are maintained in the face of life and death decisions brings an authenticity to the progress of events.

The separation of information that allows each thread to play out without being warped by events in another thread, that couldn't and shouldn't be known, is a key component in bringing drama to the table.

Besides all of that, the casting is good for the most part, and with believable performances it is easy to find more than one character to care about, to invest some emotions with and to hope for."
135,"I am writing this as I am re-watching the first season On Demand in preparation for the April 1 premier of the second season. Currently the original series is rated at 9.4 stars with 94,807 votes; I don't recall ever seeing a show rated so high, and with so many votes. This was a fantastic production, and I'm looking forward to the next installment.

I originally watched the series when it first aired. I had not read the books, and to be honest, didn't exactly know what I was getting into. I had thought it was set in medieval Britain, but I quickly realized the story is set in the mythical land of Westeros. This mythical setting allowed Mr. Martin the flexibility to write a fantastic tale of human lives, with love, hate, honor, betrayal, sex, lust, war, and other struggles that would have been something less had it been set on Earth. I did download an app for my iPad that was called the GoT companion, and this provided me much of the back-story that was not explained in the series. I thought the production was so good that I purchased the books once the series ended.

It seems most of the low ratings and poor reviews disliked the show because of the sex and violence. I find this humorous for a few reasons, the first being that the show is clearly rated AC, AL, N, V (AKA: Adult Content, Adult Language, Nudity, Violence). They show the ratings at the beginning of the program so that children, young and old, will not have their delicate sensibilities infringed upon. Secondly, the story is set in another time, on another world, with other gods and religions; from what we've seen so far, it appears that their gods and religions are not obsessed with human sexual practices, unlike several of our Earthy religions. That seems like a highly civilized concept if you ask me."
136,"I've only seen the first episode and I hate it. I won't ever watch another episode - I don't ever want to see any of these stupid, brutal, repulsive, head-choppers and sister-shaggers on my TV screen again.

I don't know what all the hype is about - or why millions of people claim that this is the best TV show ever. I watch better TV shows than this every single day. This is one of the worst TV shows I've ever seen - and I've seen thousands of them.

There are far too many characters, none of whom are likable. How is the audience meant to identify with - or root for - any of these neanderthals?"
137,"Game of Thrones is the best TV i have ever seen in TV history. the story is very deep and the character as well. the soundtrack is epic.

Game of thrones has drama , action , comedy , tragedy and very emotional moment that the fans will never can forget.the quality of the production is very high and the directors know what they should do to make the series amazing as same as the books.

there are many actors that i like them such as John snow , Robert stark, Oberyn Martel and so on.

i highly recommended game of thrones for all people who like drama and action as this is Epic which can't happen again for the long time.

While I watched the first episode I had the same excitement as the time when I first read the book. HBO has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. Sean Bean was born for the role of Eddard Stark. Costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. Actors are perfect for the role they play in the series."
138,"I hadn't watched this show at first, season 1 was finished by the time I started watching and I heard from many gamers (pen and paper roleplaying) that it was a truly amazing series and I assumed it to be good, but I found that it was GREAT! There are few series out there where I can sit and watch the show, truly interested in every aspect of it. I sit there wondering about every single character. The important ones, the non-important ones, the vile ones and the good ones, the annoying ones and the enjoyable ones. Character I absolutely loathe are so well written that I am always interested in what they are up to, what they're doing and what they'll do.

There are quite a few twists where for one moment you think things are going to be okay and it's going to be a stereotypical order in the storyline and then all of a sudden the scene does a 360 on you and you have no idea where they're going with the storyline. Everyone who watches this has their favourite noble family that they would like to win and have justice and take the throne. I personally want to support the under-dogs, the Starks but I'm sure others like the other nobles in different parts of the world.

I highly recommend this as I have never seen another fantasy series that was done well in so many years. If you are a lover of fantasy I'd go for it. Magic rarely comes into it, but when it does, it is something truly powerful."
139,"The only thought on my mind once the first season got over was, "" Damn.. When will April, 2012 come ??"" This show is a totally different genre in TV series. This is not a romantic comedy of 5 friends, nor is it a story of detectives.

Who could think of a TV Series based on Medieval ages and pull it off in such style.

The Best thing about the series is the cast. There is incredible detail in each scene, given that it has some big names in the cast.

This series sets an example on how to base something on a book. Bold and powerful, you will not realize that 60 minutes have flown by after each episode.

Once you watch this, go back and watch your favorite TV Series again. I guarantee, you will realize how amateur they actually are compared to The Game Of Thrones. By the way, the ending of season 1 for sure will chill you out."
140,"I have not seen a complete HBO series before. A colleague convinced me to try ""Game of Thrones."" I did watch the first episode and never looked back. Over the past days, I watched one episode a day until I completed all 10 episodes of the first season. It was that good. You'd never want to be kept hanging.

The series brings us back to a medieval time with kings and queens, lords and ladies. It showed things as they probably were back then, grimy, rough and violent. There was very little of the glitz and glamor that mark modern royalty nowadays. It shows the political intrigues of the aristocracy, as well as their advisers, whores and knights behind them.

It is also about family. The central family were the Starks. Eddard was picked by his good friend King Robert (family Baratheon) to be his Hand (or executive officer). This threw the Stark family (wife, five kids and one bastard) into the political fray after after their long quiet existence in the North. There is also the Lannister family of the Queen Cersei (a nebulously sinister Lena Headey), constantly waiting for an opportunity to grab power. And finally, the very blond Targaryen family who ruled the realm before Robert, now down to their last two members, the crazy Viserys (Harry Lloyd) and his meek sister Daenerys (Emilia Clarke).

As you can envision, the action in the battles, sword fights, and jousting scenes were very graphic and bloody. We were not spared the sight of gushing severed arteries, festering wounds, impaled heads and animal attacks. This is definitely not for the faint of heart! You can just look away and the sound effects do just as well to convey the gore on screen. On the other end of the Rated MA spectrum are the occasional sex scenes with both female and male members on display. These may be called gratuitous for TV, but I do gather these are also part of the books. Nevertheless, the sight of a 10-year old boy breastfeeding from his mother was still very disturbing, even in these days.

For someone who had not yet read the books, the way the story was written for TV and the directorial execution were very good. The ending scene of the first episode alone will make you want to be back for more. Love those endings for most episodes, aside from Episode 1, those of 7 and 9 will really shock you! There are things that happen that you would never predict. The fates of the characters were very unpredictable up to the very last episode. The ending of the last episode gives the series another dimension, whetting our appetite for the next season.

The writing may be archaic in vocabulary and construction, but yet they are crisp and witty, especially those that uttered by the dwarf Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage in his Emmy-nominated role). The set design of the the throne room, the dungeons that open into cliffs, the war camps were excellent. The cinematography was sweeping when it needs to be majestic, and intimate where it was necessary to be claustrophobic. I did not know most of the actors here, but they will affect you as they portray their characters were portrayed, be it hero, villain or double-agent. Aside from Bean, Headey and Dinklage, special mention go to Michelle Fairley (as Eddard's strong wife Catelyn), Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau (as the rogue Jamie Lannister) and Jason Momoa (as the imposing Khal Drogo).

This show deserves its Emmy nomination for Best Drama. Definitely, I will be back to watch the second season. I will also be reading the novels by George RR Martin that inspired this sweeping epic series."
141,"First i must warn you i'm a book-fan and could be biased in this review.

Since i've read books first, i've eagerly awaited this show and followed it from the start of the production, with inside views, teasers and trailers and all i can say it's - great. Although i was skeptical ahead of the first season, my fears were without reason, HBO did great job with it, and all i can hope for is that they'll continue doing it in next season(s).

One thing has to be pointed out, story is very complex, with a lot of details, something you cannot transfer to the screen easily. Series lack certain information and it'll be obvious even to common viewer that it's only the tip of the ice berg, and hopefully he/she will get interested in a books. That's a plus, as you can only enrich your viewing experience by reading the books (and books have re-read value as well, just then you get all the smaller hints author has weaved in the story). So, in that matter, series cannot entirely reflect the books, but it's one of the best adaptations i've ever seen.

Second, cast has been amazingly done, from young and perspective Maisie Williams who is a total discovery to me, to already proved Sean Bean or Peter Dinklage. There're only few roles in which i would cast different actors, and neither of it is main character. Jerome Flynn (Bronn) has made his character even better (or should i say ""more notable"") then in the books, totally my vision of it.

As authors of the series had great story to tell us, cast has been magnificent as well and costumes and CGI effects were fine at least, i cannot find a reason to give smaller mark here. First season (book) was just introduction to the world of Westeros and it's people and i can only hope series will keep it's quality in the future.

With that said, i'll point out few things i didn't liked. First, and the biggest, is absolute absence of battles. There were two important ones in first season and we haven't seen anything of it. Not that it bothers me at current stage, but later on battles will be integral part of the storyline and HBO won't be able to avoid it. I know it's to lower the cost, but that would reduce the quality and make harm to the series in my opinion. Second is small number of episodes, so most of the scenes are hasted. That's especially obvious in ""important"" scenes which should be given more screen time, when there's no time at all. I'm well aware it's budget problem, and if there's place for improvement, then that's budget. Raise it and series will get even better. Third, and last, is absence of flashbacks to the period of time before Robert ruled. That period is important and i thought it'll get some time, but they've decided to totally remove it from first season, hopefully in second season it'll change and we'll get to see how House Targaryen got to rule, and some Lyanna Stark flashbacks too.

With more episodes series could be even more improved, adding more depth to story and characters, but even if it keeps it's current level it's already my personal favorite fantasy series out there. If you want to get more insight to the Westeros world you'll need to read the books, but even without it you get the picture and can enjoy the best and most accurate book adaption there is."
142,"I stumbled on this show while flipping through the channels one evening, and was pleasantly surprised to find a fantasy genre show that isn't completely worthless. In fact, this show is so good I went out and bought all the books, which are extremely well written themselves. This show reminded me why I loved Lord of the Rings so much as a kid, and seeing Sean Bean's familiar face added to that effect as well. Each character in this series seems exquisitely crafted, not one major character is dull or flat and keeps you constantly guessing on how things will turn out at the end of every episode. The production value of this show is very high, the acting is fantastic, and the plot is altogether enthralling. I highly recommend it even if you aren't a fantasy genre fan."
143,"I thought Tudors and Rome were going to be almost impossible to top. Camelot has been attempting to make an attempt. It passes the time.

Game Of Thrones has me wanting more each week in the same way ""The Wire"" did. The multi-threaded story lines, terrific writing and acting, Lord of the Rings-like fantasy but remaining serious enough to get your anxiety up about what happens next.

HBO - promote the person who greenlit this. You have enough story to run several seasons. Including a big screen 2 or 3 part, (each part 2+ hours) movie to cover the pre-stories before Game of Thrones starts. Let's see how the Dragons were used, Let's see how Kahl came to be Leader, Let's see the battles of Jamie Lannister, .... HBO, you could spend the next 10 years on this story if you want.

Its awesome. Well done!"
144,"Being a big fan of George R. R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series, I had very high hopes when I heard that HBO were turning it into a T.V series, and was expecting to be disappointed. As it turned out, disappointment didn't even cross my mind whilst watching the first episode.

Two episodes shown so far and ""Game of Thrones"" is already in my top 10 T.V shows of all time.

The acting is superb, with no actor/actress delivering an unsatisfactory performance - they stay completely loyal to the characters George R. R. Martin created, and the results are always fantastic. The dialog and attitudes of each character are very typical of a medieval fantasy series, which shows that the actors and developers alike have managed to perfectly capture the atmosphere of such a time and place.

The setting is exactly as I imagined it would be after reading the books published so far, with the Haunted Forest being particularly unsettling at the start of episode 1. So, top marks for that as well.

The effects used are never over-the-top, which I always like to see in either a movie or T.V show, as some movies have to rely solely on good visuals to win over an audience (Avatar springs to mind here...).

Perhaps the best thing about the T.V show yet is how loyal it remains to the first book of the series. Every important scene, and some of the great witty remarks of certain characters, are played out to great effect exactly as they are written. The one thing that the T.V show does NOT remain loyal to is the age of the Stark children, Lannister children and of Dany. However, this is perfectly understandable, due to some of the scenes the children are involved in (no spoilers, but suffice it to say, they are pretty shocking at times, particularly in Dany's case).

All in all, I have to give ""Game of Thrones"" 10 out of 10, but not just because I am a huge fan of the book series; because it is a superb show, with excellent acting, a great realistic atmosphere, terrific sets... and it manages to remain loyal to its written counterpart amidst all the inspiring greatness."
145,"I have read Game of Thrones more than once, and I am exceptionally pleased with the HBO adaptation thus far. I just finished watching Episode 2. I find the actors to be nearly perfectly suited for the book's characters. The book is rather slow, with a lot of character complexity and social intrigue. The television series adapts this very well by presenting the most poignant moments from the book, the ones that capture the essence of a character or the mood of a scene. My wife does not like fantasy, but she is completely captivated by this series. The story is more true to the many shades of human nature than, say, ""Lord of the Rings"" or other popular fantasy fare. Therefore it transcends the limits of its genre and will appeal to fantasy aficionados and non-geeks alike. It is also dark, raw, and realistic. Therefore trees don't whistle tunes and good guys don't always end up on top. As a fan of the books, based on the first two episodes alone, I believe that HBO has done an outstanding job of adapting George R.R. Martin's ""Game of Thrones"" to television. I highly recommend watching this series."
146,"Where Game of Thrones stumbles is it's (dis)ability to properly handle characters and a story at once. The creators of this show are apparently bound on showing needless scenes of naked woman belittling themselves in every episode. Nothing is right with that statement. Just because your show is on HBO doesn't mean nudity needs to appear whenever possible. See Silicon Valley, why can't all HBO shows handle nudity like that? Oh yeah, because Game of Thrones needs an audience. Strip the nudity and you have a worthless show that may be the most atrocious thing to ever exist. Perhaps you will all see come the final season, because eventually the writers have to stop daydreaming of women and actually make a television show."
147,"This show started with promise, as I'm a huge Sean Bean and medieval fan...but with an absolutely nauseating amount of gratuitous and unnecessary sex and gore, my opinion turned sour very quickly. I don't consider myself high brow, but the sex and violence in this show for the most part is geared towards a simple-minded audience...which I'm not a grunting ape so I necessitate more than that.

Oh and lest I forget, I could overlook a bunch of the raunchy scenes if not for the unbelievably irritating character of Joffrey. That little puke completely ruins this show as I get so annoyed every time he's on screen that I grit my teeth and can't even watch.

By the 7th episode, I was done and sent back my unopened second season to Amazon.

Furthermore, Ned, his illegitimate son, and sword fighting daughter are the only likable characters. However, they get mucked over at every single turn with no repercussions...which I choose to voyeur into escapism in order to get away from injustice, not watch more of it.

I'm amazed at the high praise this trash gets, but I suppose it's a social commentary on what the current populous thinks is entertainment.

Sorry I wasted my time."
148,"Game of thrones must be the most overrated show I've ever seen. I've suffered through 5 season of this garbage so far and I simply cannot understand why anyone would ever like this show. You can sum up the whole show in one word: violence. This show basically shows people get physically and emotionally tortured and killed for five seasons. That's it. Nothing else is happening. They're trying to make it look like a political thriller full of intrigue, betrayal and plot twists. But it's not. All the scheming and colluding the characters do leads to nothing, because they all eventually get tortured and brutally killed. There is no action, there are no battles, there is no strategy, there is no mystery, there is no magic. Although they keep promising all of that since s01e01. There's just pointless violence.

Watch this only if you've already watched every other show ever made ever."
149,"After watching the first episode i was so impressed and impatient that i decided to read the book immediately to see what happens next. Then i thought that i should wait at least for a couple more weeks to see how the adaption goes before i write the review - i found no need because, hence small changes for the sake of the show, it is excellent.

This show is amazing. The plot is very, very good and complex and has so many different layers that only it should keep people wanting to see what comes in the future. I won't even start with the characters: they are brilliant and so different that everyone should find someone to root for. And thanks to this being TV-series, we can have true and believable character development, something that many fantasy films lack these days. Constant plot twists and sudden deaths are heartbreaking to say the least, but after every shock the show just manages to keep the grip on the viewers even tighter.

The cinematography. Nothing to say except praise. The medieval-like era and wintery aura give the story a grim and dark background, which suits, again, very well. The special effects are splendid, just take a look at the Wall or the large cities, or the dragons and white walkers in the later seasons.

The acting is very good as well. The cast itself is splendid, with most of it coming from the British theater scene. Sean Bean captures Eddard Stark impressively and Peter Dinklage as Tyrion or newcomer Kit Harington as Jon Snow are just a few examples.

After the fifth season the show will undoubtedly take a new path and will still have us waiting eagerly for the next episode. As for the show, just sit back, enjoy, and let yourself be taken over by this magnificent world."
150,"Perhaps the most overrated and pointless show in television history, filled with a cast that wants to do something original but just can't tap the vein, a writing team that can never truly come up with great dialog or enough memorable moments, and so much useless nudity that anyone who truly appreciates story over pointless attempts to gain viewers will be turned off within ten minutes. The show does do right, though, with how it rests solely on HBO - hopefully it stays that way. This way, people who have regular cable will never have to sit through such a boring and overrated show. The only thing that people have right is that the camera-work on this show is actually decent, but Breaking Bad topped this thing in every episode, and sometimes an episode would go by in BrBa without a single great camera angle. GOT is overrated to the max, and that's the truth."
151,"Or Emmy, or whatever the star of an HBO series might be nominated for.

This guy has always had the talent, but here he gets a chance to showcase it. Nobody, and I mean nobody, could play Tyrion that well. That's a critical role to this series too. Well done Peter. Keep up the great work.

Casting and performances are really good across the board. Some of this probably makes no sense to people who haven't read the books, but to them I say ""GO READ THE BOOKS!!!"". Best series of books ever written, and this series is VERY good so far.

I'll be purchasing the box set when it comes out. I hope they keep it going throughout the series. I might have to go read the entire series again after I get my hands on A Dance With Dragons.

Don't miss this one folks, and read the books."
152,"For those new to this thing, the only reason Game of thrones the book series got so much undeserved attention is because it went in the opposite direction of the fantasy genre's rules. Instead of a classic good vs evil take it went for the everybody's in the Grey area. The problems started right there, cos for most people fantasy is the genre where you want classic good vs evil battles and you can sometimes show the honourable side of a villain, doesn't mean they get as equally good moral compasses as the heroes. Thats what the drama genre is for. The second thing thats wrong with the books is that they simply have no sense of direction, like when the first harry potter book was being written by J.K Rowling, she knew how the story was going to pan out. She knew it would be a seven book series and had a bird's eye view of the future works. Game of thrones simply is an improv sketch, where George Martin made the story up as it went along. Some of the stories just makes no sense , its like watching the life of an ordinary guy, nothing happening, story not leading to anything , any event. Even though HBO has thrown in some big budget sets, VFX and good actors, this ultimate sense of futility will definitely start getting to you from season two/three. Remember all the fun times we had hating mindless gore/sadistic movies and calling everyone that watched them sick. Well hurray, this show just managed to convert everyone to the other side. Now you can just cut the head of lead and noble characters, and call it unimaginable plot twist. Killing the hero is not a plot twist, ending of Sixth sense was a plot twist. Any idiot can create a sense of shock by suddenly killing of the most important characters in the show.

I don't know if any of you have seen The Hot Tub Time Machine, but in it there's a scene where John Cusack's character asks the kid why he's wasting his time in a game(second life) just being in prison taking push ups. I mean this is the place where you get to do the impossible stuff, so why not go kill some orcs or terrorists and be a hero? Game of thrones is ruining the fantasy genre like that. This is an escapist genre, where you don't have to be reminded of the grim, boring nature of our lives, a genre where heroes are born, epic battles are conducted, where there is always light at the end of darkness, hope that makes you want to live. In short, If you like your TV shows to make no sense, no purpose, and you re happy to just watch fictional characters living out their lives, talking matters of no importance to each other, cutting heads, raping, molesting, where the hero always dies, you ll find it sufferable."
153,"Have to say that shortly after the start of season five I have become weary of so much sadistic violence over and over again and not anything good ever happening. The story line keeps dragging on and on with seemingly only new angles on just what different and graphic forms of killing and mutilation can be devised and delivered with optimum special effects. It is a game of thrones and a game where not only nobody wins but just how badly everyone loses, one at a time, told in layered story groupings, episode after episode. Enough already. Apparently this is what keeps the series ratings high and I just no longer want to be a part of this feed so goodbye Game of Thrones."
154,"I cannot understand why this series is so successful. I guess it's only because of the violence, sex and nudity displayed plainly within that draws people to watch it. The story of the whole concept is nothing they care about. First of all, the title is wrong. ""A Game of Thrones"" is only the name of the first of the seven books of the heptalogy of ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". Maybe it sounds a bit more attractive, yes, but it's not the title it should bear. The most annoying thing about it all is that the characters are much much OLDER than they actually should be, twice the age and also not captured well. E.g. Joffrey Baratheon has become one of the most hated characters, but if you read the books, you may know there ARE equally vile characters in the story, if not worse. He shouldn't be more than 13, but in the series it is a 23 year-old lad who portrays him. Daenerys should be 15, yet in the series she is a 30 year-old woman. And so can I go on and on. Sean Bean as Eddard Stark? Really? He would be my last choice and Arya was supposed to be skinny... Second, why so much nudity and sex? I do not claim that in the books there isn't mentioned how characters are having sex, but it gets lost among thousands of other more important and interesting and more described adventures, and it's purpose is just to make a background and show us the nature of some of the characters. The books are NOT about brothels, the word ""brothel"" is just mentioned. All I want to say - if you read the books, why should you spoil your imagination by watching this? Let yourself immerse in the great prose of George R. R. Martin and let the series for those who prefer watching this horribly made adaptation over reading and letting their imagination free. My only question is how could Martin consent to such an adaptation of his fantastic books?"
155,"Game of Thrones is a poorly adapted show that is well suited for plebes. It is not a faithful adaptation of Song of Ice & Fire series. This show had lots of unnecessary changes that infuriated me. The showrunners replace many important scenes with meaningless garbage. GoT ends up missing important scenes and dialogue from the books. GoT lacks any substance, and creativity. The showrunners made too many mistakes. GoT does not deserve praise, but scrutiny. Critics should be embarrassed for praising Game of Thrones. No reviewer is that stupid. This show has too many problems to be praised. I personally think that the showrunners simply bribed the critics into giving the show a positive review. No reviewer would ever give a 9.5 average rating on IMDb for this sh@t. Unless he was bought. GoT List of Problems: 1. Poorly written characters (Dull, & boring generic characters). 2. Lack of foresight when writing these characters. 3. Lack of development. 4. Poorly structured story. 5. Each season is crammed into one book. The seasons should have focused on one book. We would have ended up with better written characters and a fleshed out story. 6. Miscast characters. 7. Missed scenes: many key details missed. 8. Not a cohesive story. GoT masquerades as a good series. The truth is that Game of Thrones is nothing but an overrated pile of sh@t. All GoT has going for it is sex and violence. The success of Game of Thrones is attributed largely to the plebes' lack of taste. This show is made to entertain plebes. If you doubt the review I had written. Please go back and read the books. You would see that Game of Thrones is nothing but a missed opportunity."
156,"This show is damn awesome.

The location, the characters, the targeriyans, the king's road, the dragon egg's, the mad king, the loyal friend, the bastards, the dwarfs, the traitors, the plotters, the unholy lovers, the pet- wolves, the night's watch, the WALL, the blue eyed spirits of the haunted forest, the noob who becomes the king, the cunning lannisters, the prince with blonde hair, the tyranny surrounding the word Khal Drogo, the gulf of grief, the chameleon Baelish, and much much more!

I don't generally prefer TV shows because they run too long and the story keeps never ends. Luckily my friend recommended that since entire season 1 is out there, why not watch it all? Here's the twist, each episode is a master-piece.

I watched first episode, my mind blew-off in bewilderment of the 'pure' violence & love, the characters displayed to play the Game of Thrones.

The Baratheon King is a extremely cunning character, who never takes the center stage and yet remains purely in power. The Starks are the most lovable family with an unfathomable family pride. The all- powerful Lannisters, a family or kingdom in themselves. The bastard dwarf is one of best characters I have ever seen in any TV show. A character so tiny yet so powerful. Tyrion Lannister's dialogue delivery & portrayal of 'the bastards' is absolutely stunning. He is chatty and witty, probably the only Lannister without the trademark characteristics of a Lannister!

and I could go on and on about the other characters!

More than anything, all episodes remains absolutely loyal to the title, 'Game of Thrones'."
157,"I've never read the books so had no idea what to expect when I started watching this series. But everyone I knew who had read the books raved about them, so I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I don't know that I would've stuck with the books if I'd started those first, with some subjects, I find visual images more interesting than printed versions.

I have to say, I'm officially hooked, and have just finished the fourth series. I've never been disappointed with most of the acting, some of the leads are particularly good. The people you're meant to despise do an epic job of making you feel exactly the right way. But then again, some of those I hated at first have now become my favourites, the character development has been excellent. I found some story lines truly shocking and upsetting, since I'd grown to really care about the people involved.

It has a lot of fantasy elements also, which make the story even more interesting for me. The CG is really good and hasn't disappointed. The violence is quite extreme and very convincing, and has made me gag a little now and then, but it just adds to the realism. Some of the sex scenes are also a bit gratuitous, but nothing I'd really complain about.

There's only one main character who's got on my nerves to the point where I hate her scenes, she's so smug and self-entitled, but seems to be a favourite among fans. I'm hoping she either gets knocked off her high horse (or rather her dragon), or she develops some humility and grows on me.

I'd highly recommend this show to anyone. I never believed I'd get so immersed, but I can't wait for the next season."
158,"The characters are among the most memorable ever, the acting and writing is amazing. My favorite thing about the series is how much you get into it. For example there are characters that even though we know they're just acting we either hate them with all our might, we cry when great characters die, and we feel connected with these well crafted characters.

The story is on a very large scale that at first seems impossible to keep track of because it's so large but eventually when you adapt to the show you know exactly who's who and what's what. Once you get there the show is a non stop enjoyment with some of the most memorable moments in television.

There's lots of sex, graphic violence, and so on and some complain about it being a ""porno"" but to me it wouldn't feel right without all the exploited things in this show. If you are into a show you can hinge nearly nonstop without getting bored here you go."
159,"I've always used to see many TV shows, but when, on April 2014, I saw Game Of Thrones for the first time, I realized that it is much more than just a TV show: maybe, someday this will became EPIC, and children will study GOT instead of ancient Greek mythology etc.

I don't like to read the book after I've seen the movie or see the movie after I've liked a book, but this time I'm reading all the books, I'm already at the third one, also if I have a busy life!

Landscapes are wonderful, such as the show is based on real middle-age history and customs. It is called fantasy, and I've heard many guys saying that GOT it's just violence and nudes, but it is not. There is just a few magic, but the real wars are fought with brains, and as the show goes on, you won't care anymore of blood and sexuality.

There is not any main character, anyone could die in every single moment, this is sometimes sad, but I've never seen anything like that!

Perfect casting, George R.R. Martin is a master of suspense...what else do I have to say? Just see it!"
160,"Quite a slow start in my opinion, but oh my mother of dragons it became good! I could make a list of perfect things in this TV-Series so long so you had to sleep before you were done reading, but I'll keep it short! The acting was so freaking good, especially from Jack Gleeson (Joffrey Baratheon) whose head you want to crush until there's no life left of him. Then the music - so excellent! When I first heard it it was almost as if I got goosebumps. Well, it doesn't surprise me now, when I've seen how perfect everything is in this TV-Series.

When I first started watching this show I wasn't satisfied, but that was mainly because I watched like 10 minutes and wasn't patient at all. My friends and my brother made me give it another try so I did, with the thoughts of negativity towards the show. But the more I watched, the more I saw what a masterpiece of a TV-Series this was. Now I've even bought the books in hope of one day read through them all... (Halfway through the first one at the moment). Can't wait to see how it all turns out in the end!"
161,"Most of television drama show has the something that they all share it, as the same, 99% of the series are one side character, in which its the story of one man/woman, while the rest of the cast rust being just sidetrack or supporting, in the Game of Thrones which its based on *The song of ice and fire Novel* its on a league of his own, because the show has so many lead character and there is not a single person that can be pointed as the main character over the others, the plot its just wondefuly written with many plot/twist.

its a survivor story in which there are so many possibilities, many character with complex personalities and morality, this its not the typical show with Good guys vs the bad guys, its all about scheming and backstabbing."
162,"This show and I assume the book(if the show is anyway accurate) paint a very depressing and twisted look into the human mind. The minute any character shows any decency, honor, loyalty or trust. They are shown to be weak and foolish then killed off. Not only are cruelty, deceit and selfishness needed to gain power and wealth, these characteristics are also needed to find justice for those who have been wronged. This means that any character that wants justice or to perform good deeds has to betray the principles they stand for to achieve these goals. I see no originality in this show only gratuitous violence and endless betrayal and backstabbing. Any 2 people who marry for love rather than power and wealth end up dead, so it is a fantasy world where happiness in unattainable as the wealthy and powerful are miserable fighting to hold what they have and acquire more and anyone not concerned with these things gets trampled on and used. It seems the the author of Game of Thrones may be quite right though since the books and show are so popular humans really do enjoy violence and treachery. Production values are good."
163,"What can I say? There is no other show like Game of Thrones. It is simply the best.

Where do I start? Well, I would like to first point out that of all the TV shows out there, very few of them I watch and even fewer are the ones that I legitimately love. It is not like the majority of other shows are bad or terribly made, it is simply the fact that with so many TV shows out there, patterns become evident, story lines become uncreative and repetitive and once you've seen enough shows, other ones become predictable. A handful, such as 24, Psych, Vikings, Black Sails and of course, Game of Thrones, truly pique my interest.

With that said, Game of Thrones is stunning in basically every aspect. Wonderfully adapted from George R. R. Martin's incredible novels, Game of Thrones brings to life the world of Westeros (and Essos). I am a huge fan of the books as well and I can say that the show stays very faithful to the books. Of course, slight changes are made, but this has to happen on occasion, and I have rather enjoyed most of the changes.

Things I love about the show: The plot line. This is the cornerstone of Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire. The plot line is what makes the show so amazing and intriguing. It is a masterfully written story about kings and queens, lord and ladies, knights and warriors, children and adults, love and betrayal, politics and war and good and evil. The characters take it to a whole other level. The characters are so diverse yet so realistic. I'm sure each one of us can find one character we can relate to or at least sympathize with. Characters are loved while others are hated and furthermore, others remain neutral, fooling even the most dedicated audience to what they might do next (looking at you Petyr Baelish). Apart from the books, the show is able to bring all the visual aspects forward in stunning display. Namely the filming locations and costume designs. Croatia, Ireland, Morocco and Iceland provide for most of the scenery and man if it isn't beautiful. It is authentic and rugged and provides the perfect opportunity for bringing the World of Ice and Fire to life. The acting is incredible and performed by an amazing cast. Peter Dinklage, Jack Gleeson, Lena Headey, Charles Dance, Kit Harington, Sean Bean and Iain Glen are among the best. Finally, the action scenes are wonderfully done. Realistic and gritty yet still intense and a joy to watch. Who doesn't like big battles and epic scenes of single combat fights?

Now, if there is one thing that I do not like about the show, it is the sexual content/nudity. While I admit some of it is necessary, I think it is a little over the top. I know this is HBO and HBO specifically caters to adults, but extended brothel scenes with nudity for the sake of nudity? Not exactly a fan of that. It certainly takes away from the bigger and more important events going on elsewhere in Westeros.

Despite my dislike for the unnecessary nudity, the show as a whole has my rating of a 9.5! But since that is not an option, I'll have to give it a 10.

I will always love this show and I cannot wait for the upcoming seasons! Remember, Winter is coming.

Favorite characters: Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Ned Stark and Ser Jorah Mormont (close behind them is Arya, Varys, Jaime and Samwell).

Favorite episode(s): Watchers on the Wall and Rains of Castamere. The Children is another amazing one.

Keep up the good work GRRM, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss!"
164,"This perversity parade is DEAD SERIOUS. Dead serious about glorifying totally boring, totally banal, totally petty human aggressive impulses.

This show tries to push boundary over and beyond deepest recesses of (what's left of) viewers' souls. The great minds artfully constructs and expertly re-framed the yuckiest visuals of mangled, disfigured, putrid human body bits into barely edible forms acceptable by the bloodthirsty, pent-up mainstream.

It succeeded! Bloody no-holds-bar brutality is now the new political correctness! Yay!

This is a perfect show for those who take feral beastly human behavior VERY SERIOUSLY! Like, wow, mere combo of the usual blood and sword and breasts and dragons and fantasy kitsch costumes equal SERIOUS great art or something!

The biggest crowd pleaser goes to... DEAD SERIOUS parades of FEMALE BODY HUMILIATION !!

Very fair distribution of female hatred and humiliations too: all classes of all age group of females are covered: prepubescent girls, peasant sisters, princesses, exotic escorts, mommy queen...all stripped, poked, stabbed, sliced open, hung, paraded, trashed, spat on, MERCILESSLY DISFIGURED WITH all sorts of sharp hard weapons and stinkiest filth and vilest concepts one can think of. Great achievements...

The uglier and more gruesome the spectacle, the pettier and meaner the torture scenes and female disfigurement, the louder the planet of the apes cheer from probably some kind of orgasmic catharsis! 11 out of 10!!!

Oh yes, it has a plot. Nice sets. Good actors. Long story arc, yada yada.

Please don't censor this show though. Let the raging hatred and toxic bile flow. Let it all out. so that the evolved ones could use this as a barometer to filter out chimps from supposedly civilized potential mates. So that one day in the future, we could use this as a text book to teach our great grand children about our residual-chimpanzee legacy."
165,"I watch the series because my boyfriend is a fan. I've tried to like it, but it's hard you know?I don't mind violence and sex, but I think this is the only thing Game of Thrones has to offer.

For me it's just terrible, the characters are the worst human beings portrayed on TV. They don't know loyalty, friendship or respect. All I see is gossip and betrayal, with tons of sex and naked girls just because.

Even after watching the first episode of the third season I still don't know what the plot is. There were so many screen time for silly fights between lovers I tought I was watching Gossip Girl."
166,If your a fan of the books this show will infuriate you. If Weiss and benioff wanted to write their own story than why did they have to buy the rights to song of ice and fire. GRRM is a brilliant writer and has created a world many people love. Weiss/benioff have taken his amazing source material and rewritten it very poorly. Changing story lines to point that make little sense. Changed characters personalities and arcs. Killed off characters who still play a huge role in the books. And most importantly taken GRRMs amazing dialogue and replaced it with poorly written garbage. I know books have to be changed for screen but a complete rewrite is ridiculous. Could've just wrote your own story and left westeros alone.
167,"So much violence, and especially violence against women, and yet in this modern world, where we live, and most of us stand for democracy and human rights, so many people like this show. Please, tell me why. I don't want to add any spoilers, but every woman in this show is so much degraded, even if she was made strong in the first place. Ant that makes me even more curious of why would someone like it, except some people who hate women.. but I just cant believe that the world has so much of those.."
168,"Absolutely Hated Seasons 2 & 3. The show seemed like it was going somewhere with Season 1 which had a well written plot and characters but that ALL goes down the drain after the Season 1 Finale! Sean Bean was seriously miscast. In fact, most of the actors are miscast and do a TERRIBLE job! I mean, have you seen the ""Red Wedding""? That's when I dropped the show as it just got too ridiculous and derivative. The battles are too cliché and just Lord of the Rings rip-offs! Even if they are rip-offs, they can still be handled well but after Season 2...complete Garbage!

Yeah, Game Of Thrones SUCKS! :("
169,"Firstly, to dispel the views of many a reviewer, I am not a fan boy of either fantasy nor the books from which this television series are adapted from.

Secondly, I would like to spend a paragraph addressing the views on violence and nudity. I cannot for the life of me understand the accusations of sexually explicit content and hideous violence being completely unfounded, doing nothing for the show. In that accusation alone you disprove your claim. By admitting your repulsion, you have simultaneously admitted that the tone and setting have worked perfectly. You are supposed to be repulsed. You are meant to think these scenes are common place, and against your will or not, they absolutely do add to the tone that the writer was attempting to achieve. A time of different morals, casual exploitation, and a world where men rule and women are objects. This only makes the leading female characters of the show all the more enthralling when they dominate a scene and act as a catalyst for huge plot twists. Joffrey's mother is a constant schemer and her character contrasts perfectly with the ""hundreds"" of naked women on screen (a gross over-exaggeration).

To comment on the violence and nudity in such a manner only depicts to a viewer like myself that this show, simply put, does not adhere perfectly to your tastes. Personally, without the violence and adult themes, this show really would be about as gritty as silky knickers. Grow up and accept the fact that in this day an age, you cannot get the budget to produce an adult-aimed TV show and omit violence. Where it differs from Lord of the Rings is that it attempts to at least partly set itself against the back drop of the notoriously gritty middle ages. What were you expecting? Fairy's? Every single act of violence serves to remind you that this is a vicious age. It comes from all characters, sometimes feeling forced, sometimes feeling gratuitous. More often than not however, it comes from the characters who themselves love violence (the hound, Joffrey etc...) Given the sheer volume of plots, sub-plots, characters and material to process, I think you are being completely unreasonable expecting some critic friendly genius masterpiece that equals the sopranos for complexity and realistic drama. The sopranos is set in a real city, in the current age, don't be so ridiculous as to cast the same eye over these two shows.

I saw a review whereby somebody had watched ""6 minutes"" and dismissed it as drivel. You honestly expect somebody to take your review seriously!? It is without doubt a slow burner, the characters are not given enough screen time per episode... maybe because it is an hour long and there are 7 divisions of character to depict. Rest assured early viewer, the characters screen time will add up by the second series. You will begin to understand in greater detail the motives and development of them, and if you can stomach the odd bit of violence and sex- hell, if you are even enough of a shameful human being to actually enjoy these things on screen (as I am) then you WILL love this show, you will appreciate its place on the television today, and you will ignore the opinionated television snobs who have watched two episodes and feel it necessary to moan about the adult content, on an adult themed TV show. Don't watch it, don't give a review on it. I have never felt it necessary to watch sex in the city, I know it does not appeal to my taste. If I did, I would comment that it is shameful rubbish that warps the minds of human beings far more than an epic fantasy drama set a thousand years ago does. But I don't, because it is not a show that is MEANT to appeal to me. It is not made for people like me.

Game of thrones is well worth a chance. I gave it a chance and I do not regret it."
170,"They say you should never judge a book by its cover. Likewise, you should never judge a film or TV series by its IMDb rating. There's not much that I can add to the criticisms that have been leveled at this pretentious, humorless and vacuous twaddle, especially as I only just managed to get to the end of the first episode. But from what I've read, nothing much changes, and I've certainly got far better, if lower rated, shows and films to spend my time watching. I'm sure that if I was about 13 years old again I'd love it, but it's a total mystery to me why it has so many 'adult' fans. I guess a lot of people just lead boring everyday lives and need to escape into this kind of childish fantasy."
171,"Just so you know where I'm coming from, I've never heard of ""Game of Thrones""(not the board game, books, etc) until the show was released. In fact, the only time I heard it even mentioned was when my friends discussed the previous night's TV shows. Prior to watching the show, the only thing I knew about it was that it was fantasy. I should also mention that I hate fantasy books and movies.

However, ""Game of Thrones"" totally blew me away. Even for HBO's standards, this show is just epic. I rate this show an firm 10/10.

A little about the show: the show takes place in an alternate world that is so meticulously set out that one would think that it's real. Each house's history is so complex, the characters so realistically dimensional that I'm not sure I was watching a documentary or a fictional show. This, however, is not a series about fighting and bloodshed. This show is all politics and relationships between people, classes, and races.

What I like about the show: HBO really outdid itself with ""Game of Thrones."" $5 million dollars per episode...and every penny worth its price. The physical settings could not have been more realistic. Castles and deserts, city streets and tundra, every backdrop was absolutely convincing, and this only serves to underline one of the shows greatest strengths: the depth of the ""Game of Thrones"" universe. I also must mention the strength of the acting of the whole cast, not just Peter Dinklage (who was particularly brilliant). I'd even say that each actor was born to play their GoT character (not really, but you get my point). Again, I have to commend HBO, this time for selecting an effective cast. I would not be surprised if several of these actors go on to become premier TV stars, if not A-List movie actors.

So now, after watching one season of this show, I am a total Song of Fire and Ice junkie and I have gotten my whole family hooked on this show as well. Do I recommend this TV show? Well, only if you are not scared of being blinded at the brilliance of this show."
172,"My rate for GoT was 9 but as the last season was a rather slightly disappointing experience, and the start of the last season with that ""revelation"" about Jon Snow's origin is also rather a boring affair, my rate dropped to 7.

Of course, the production and the acting is still superb but the more we come closer to the final the more the story/plotline of GoT got into the realm of very ordinary ""fantasy"" storytelling.

The last season we (assumingly) will just watch the opposing forces gather their armies till the final battle, therefore I guess the season and the conclusion of the show will not hold the level of the first 5 to 6 seasons.

But the one good thing here is, that we know the curtains will be closed soon for good, whereas The Walking Dead will bore us to hell with maybe a couple of more seasons."
173,"It seems the days of good fantasy are now dead forever. Gone are the worlds of magic and mysticism to be replaced by graphic sex and even more graphic violence. Tolkien and Lewis are doing somersaults in their respective graves. Now we have lots of violent battle scenes interrupted by dull, soap-opera-like pedantry. And while it may be technically impressive in it's many cartoon-like computer graphics, the actual writing and acting are embarrassingly bad. One can only feel pity for otherwise good actors like Charles Dance and the great Diana Rigg. As to the stories, they are exceedingly dull and totally unimaginative...By the way, I have trudged through 4 seemingly interminable seasons hoping it might get better, only to be seriously disappointed...and the seasons are only 10 episodes!!!"
174,"I'm not trying to be a hater here and slam this show just for slamming's sake. And to that end, I'm not even slamming this show. It is very, very well done. The set design and production value is stunning. One episode I'm sure costs the same amount as a low budget film to be sure. But while I really like this show, I don't love it. And the reason is because it is just so goddamn depressing. Call me an eternal optimist, but I have to deal with reality on a regular basis and there's already so much depressing, disgusting crap going on all over the real world, so I like my escape from reality to have a little, just a little, bit of hope. Once in a while I need a victory. And you'll be very hard pressed to find a victory during any storyline in the Game of Thrones. It's just always so much hate and hell and death and malice. Ugh. It gets to be so heavy and drawn out. Yes, it's written well, the casting is superb, but come on already. Give me someone to cheer for once in a while. I've never read the books but friends of mine who have did not enjoy them stating that everyone you love or grow attached to dies; that the author just wants to kill everyone off. I get it. From a writer's perspective, I'm sure he wants to keep everyone on their toes, sitting on the edge of their seats, but in order to keep your audience, you gotta give them a little love too.

It also says a lot about the world today in which this show is loved by everyone. Ask anyone and they'll tell you it's their favorite show. I think that says a lot about society. Everyone hates everybody and wants everyone dead and gets lots of enjoyment from all the horrible things that happen to everyone. Nice. Look at Cersei for example. Why is she so hateful? I mean, I can understand why she is now, but at the start....she had a brother whom she could hump any time she wanted, children she loved, a brother who wanted very much to be loved by her (and yet she hated for no good reason) and a father who adored her. Even as a child in flashback, she was an evil little bitch. Why? Is there an inciting incident that I missed in her life? She really is just hell-bent on killing anyone to sit in the world's most uncomfortable chair? I could see if she had been abused as a child, her family killed, loss of her wealth and driven into poverty by oppressive powers, etc. but last time I checked, her family did all that cold business to everyone else. Anyway, her motivation seems a little reaching. But of course now she has motivation with all her kids dead.

The other thing that I don't find works is that there are way too many story lines and characters and NONE of them really cross over or come together. I feel like we've been waiting forever to see Sansa and her sister cross paths. Finally Jon and Sansa are together but man it took forever. And finally when Riccan is brought together with his family it's only for a very short-lived time. I wish more of the story lines intersected. I guess it's coming because now we have Daenarys and Tyrion together which is cool so I hope they continue. But do we really need a bunch of snow zombies??? This storyline seems so lame. We've got enough characters to keep things interesting, just sayin'.

Anyway, I absolutely love dragons so that's what keeps me watching. I hope there are more dragons in this season."
175,"Game of Thrones is simply unbeatable: There's no other TV show with such complex yet perfectly tied together story lines, unexpected twists (that actually make sense!), such well- developed characters, clever dialogues, amazing photography and ever better soundtrack.

I'm sooooo glad GOT happened in my generation because I feel that this is a once-in-a-life time kind of thing. I'll be forever grateful to be experiencing this first-hand, as I assume future generations will not be able to appreciate the impact that this show has had on the TV industry and will inevitably talk about GOT in the same uninterested way ours does about ""Cheers"" or ""upstairs, downstairs"", to name a few.

GOT is a 10/10 for me. And again, this comes from someone who doesn't usually enjoy fantasy all that much."
176,"Love love love this series, so many interesting characters and story lines!"
177,"I waited 7 years to watch this show... I tried a few times between 2016-2017 but never truly tried. Finally in November of 2018 I watched it and finished season 1-7 on January 1st, 2019. I have now completed the series twice in preparation for the final season!"
178,"I've had a real love hate relationship with this show. There are a few seasons in the middle I just don't remember. It gives the illusion of lots happening, but little actually does.

Looking forward to the last season but also happy that it is the last. Which makes me a bit sad, but most people loved it so that's cool. Each to their own, I always say."
179,"This has to be the best series I have ever seen, the sole reason I got Sky is so that I could watch it.

I started a bit later than everyone else but I must've watched series 1 & 2 in the space of 2 weeks in order to watch series 3 when it aired.

It is just brilliant, you can't afford to miss anything, all the little conversations that seem like time killers play a big part on what is going to happen later on in the series.

The acting is top drawer, from all involved, the plot twists & turns, & the character development is fantastic.

It's both beautiful & brutal, you cannot afford to miss it. GET IT WATCHED!"
180,"I don't understand why people like it so much. I really tried watching it but could not continue after a few chapters. Of course, the investment in production, costumes and effect are evident, but the plot, with its very trivial 'political' hints simply is not enough to make this series what it is claimed to be. Maybe it is mainly intended for people under 18.

Disappointing."
181,"At first I was skeptical to watch. I watched the first episode and felt like there's too much darkness. I gave it a break but again gave it another chance few days later, and now the season 8 1st episode just dropped. This is the BEST SHOW EVER that is created and the best show that ever will be."
182,This is incredible Certainly u like it but final is coming its sad
183,"GoT is a well-deserved perfect rating of 10/10. What else can I say, almost every critique here already said what needs to be said. I am just extremely glad that given the fact that the Earth is approximately 4.2 Billion years old, I managed to be born in the same era as Game of Thrones."
184,"From the opening scene followed by the amazing ""Game of Thrones"" tune, you know you're in for something very special. Game of thrones shows off his high budget and really immediately draws you into its beautiful created fantasy world. From the start they show they mean business and you soon realize that you have never seen a tv show like this. Its beautiful landscapes, cities and the amazing diverse set of characters is mindblowing. From the beginning you get to know these great characters and you get to get really involved in them, whether you love a certain character or you absolutely dispise a certain character, game of thrones does it really well and it feels like you get to know these characters really well over the course of the current 7 seasons. All i can say is.... Fasten your seatbelts, enjoy the ride, get ready to be amazed, get ready to be shocked, you will cry, you will be in awe, this show has it all. An absolute masterpiece that will leave all tv shows behind itself and makes you wish for more as soon as you have watched the last episode. Warning: this show does contain shocking scenes that might not be for everyone.

FINAL VERDICT: This is isn't just a tv show its an experience not to be missed,a must watch for anyone who loves a great story, great characters and doesn't mind the occasional shock value!! Oh and did i mention..... It has dragons!!!! Enjoy everyone😉👍😊"
185,"As per usual, the IMDB fan base has flooded the review section with biased trash. It's either 10/10 or 1/10. And a load of garbage in between. Both lovers and haters have points. I feel it's a good story topped up with a bit of trash to fill in the time. If you don't like gore, don't watch it. If you don't like nudity, don't watch it. If you don't like rape, incest and gay sex. Don't watch it.

It's a good watch if you don't mind these things. Personally i have gotten sick of the whole notion of what i call ""shock value"" in tv series. Killing off characters or having a rape scene purely because there's nothing else to do. And the men, wow! This show is actually rather sexist towards men. Women have all the power in this show, which given the age the show was set for really makes no sense at all. But i realise it's the in thing these days. Having a 12yo girl (let alone any 16-17yo) become a hero is just stupid imo. It's an adult show we don't need 12yo's running around acting hero. She is a good actor and does her job very well but just portrays a ridiculous character.

Decide for yourself, don't let the 99% of completely biased 10/10 - 1/10 reviews fool you. Both have their merits and it's worth deciding for yourself, don't let the die hard fans or haters decide for you."
186,"The following is just my opinion and should not be misconstrued as fact.

""When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die"" Game of Thrones

""Forget the promise of progress and understanding. For in the the grim dark future there is only war."" Warhammer 40K

In my opinion GOT is a rehash of too many authors hard work. I acknowledge that nothing is new or original but I feel that for GOT he does not even attempt to be so. One of the biggest mistakes I made was to read Bulfinchs Mythology around the same time as GOT, at times I was certain I was reading the same story.

If you enjoyed the character deaths in GOT I'd highly recommend reading(If you're able) Dan Abnetts Warhammer 40k novels. Character deaths have meaning while at the same time show the waste of war and how it can strike anyone randomly, they move the plot forward without being dwelt upon too much but are not just glossed over.

To close this scattered collection of thoughts I'll give an example of one of the largest failings in GOT, the Red Wedding. While the lead up to the action is ham-fisted and unbelievable the event itself is fine. My gripe is that the ""Rules of Hospitality"" that had been important up to that point are thrown away to show Walders cunning. However!!! This oh so important traditional rule of not harming someone that takes ""your meat and mead"" bears no repercussions when broken.

Anyway, just my opinion and I apologize for being all over this place with my thoughts. I suppose I should also mention I've watched all the current seasons and have read all of the books in the series up to this date."
187,"So, this started like most HBO crap: lots of blood, ""in your face"" nudity to remind you why you pay the extra instead of settling for the basic cable package, and sex more sleazy than the average Hustler vid.

Except that the women of Thrones aren't ""amazing"". They look like what the porn industry throws on the ""amateur"" flicks. And thats WITH the make-up. The sex was boring; there's more chemistry in a math class than on these sets. And the fighting and blood were clearly done by someone that hasn't seen combat or held any of those weapons or armor.

Oh, and the gay pandering is so blatant, Im surprised it isn't being boycotted. Im serious, until season 5 they cant do an episode without grinding your face in gay sex. It seems like the few rare scenes that Don't involve homosexual sex in some way are the incest scenes. I've heard of ""blaxploitation"" as a category, but what do we call this? ""gaysploitation""? ""homosploitation""? Should it be more insultive, as the ""blax"" is, to show contempt for the disrespect it does to the minority pandered to?

I guess the ""kill a named character every two episodes"" mantra actually comes from the books, which is all the more reason not to read the books, to me. If I want some pompous jackwagon that spends 2 pages introducing me to the character just to immediately kill off said character, I'll go back to Victorian authors like dickens, who were paid by the letter, rather than for content.

We're in season 5, and the only character left from the beginning that you might care about is Ari. The screen-writers have gotten so desperate Cersi is naked. I realize there's an audience for middle-aged women with buzz-cuts getting pelted with garbage and sewage, I just figured it was mostly centralized in German fetishism, not HBO ""mainstream"" audience. Or maybe the two are really one and the same?

The only central plots across the seasons are ""winter is coming"", because apparently in this world that doesn't happen every year? IDK, they never address why its so important that seasons, ya know, change and stuff... Oh, and the other is, ""if you do good, your gonna get screwed"". Every character that tries to ""do the right thing"", or act good, whether in character or not, pays for it. And in GoT, there's only one way you pay: death. Often with a little creepy-border-line rapey-time as well, especially in the later seasons.

Do yourself a favor. If you want to watch porn, watch porn. If you want to watch TV, watch TV. Avoid this hybrid abortion."
188,"This show is boring, only love or court intrigues. For me, John Snow is a horrible character!"
189,"""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is a series of fast-paced fantasy epics by novelist George R.R. Martin. With a total of 4,451 pages so far, it took me a little over a month to read. It's an exciting parade of plot twists and prophecies, and explores a rich secondary world with all its cultures and history through the points of view of a diverse cast of characters.

""Game of Thrones"" is an HBO television series based on those books. It has lasted six seasons so far, and each one feels like an eternity. It is pedantic, talkative, static, and predictable. The progress of its narrative mirrors the structure of its opening theme music: circular, monotonous, and endlessly repetitive. Its plot twists take the form of stabbings, beheadings, and betrayals, but for all their apparent randomness they arrive at regular intervals -- when things are going well for a character, you know his throat will be slit by the end of the episode.

The novels were told from the points of view of its main characters, and its perspective broadened with each book, illuminating new corners of the world of Westeros and shedding new light on what's gone before. Reading the books is an experience of ongoing revelation. We gradually come to understand the story's villains, and that understanding engenders our sympathy. The show is more direct. Everything is laid bare, and the characters are transformed into cogs in the convoluted machinery of the plot. The net result is that none of the characters are truly sympathetic; we can only watch the show objectively, without really caring about what happens to anyone. All men must die, and all GoT characters will commit terrible deeds for selfish ends.

Stylistically, the show is bewilderingly dull. When the tension should be ratcheting up, Tyrion and his brother Jaime pause for a conversation about their mentally challenged cousin. Littlefinger and Varys, the show's resident Machiavellian schemers, regularly deliver expository speeches. Other characters proclaim their motives out loud, while still others happily announce things that everyone should already know. It creates the singular impression that the scripts are ninety percent filler. The gears of the plot keep inexorably turning, and the writers struggle to keep up."
190,"Game of Thrones does for medieval fantasy what Deadwood did for westerns. And like Deadwood Game of Thrones amps up the viciousness but this time to a ridiculous degree. The acting is terrific. The set design (cgi or not), costumes, directing, editing and sound are all top notch. The dialogue can be cutting and clever but also arch and melodramatic. The desperate and menacing and oh so important conversations frankly started to blur together in my head. Just when your attention might wander breasts or a new extreme in atrocities is served to remind you how cool and hardcore this world is. After a while I started to wonder how anyone is still alive in this world. Where does all this fodder come from? But for sure thousands of lives will be readily available for extinguishing next time the audience might be getting bored or needs to be reminded how nasty somebody is."
191,"I watched the 1st episode from season 1 and I have to say I'm disappointed. After the 1st episode I already know this show doesn't have anything to offer for me. So I won't be wasting my time.

I love fantasy genre in general. I have my standards and habits. I was almost shocked when I saw how this series is riding with nudity. Breasts visible all the time, naked women being toys for the guys. This was awful. I don't mind watching brutal scenes every now and then but I just can't see any reason why there has to be so much nudity.

Good fantasy story rides on with it's good script and not with nudity. This series is more Bold And The Beautiful series with soft porn scenes.

TL;DR Waste of time."
192,Too all you movie review wannabe scumbags that gave this less then a 10 wtf is a 10 to you? best TV show of all time easily. you are all monkeys.
193,"This series has wittily aggregated ancient and medieval history of mankind - mostly focusing on aristocracy, but this is the history we know, through the eyes of wealthy and powerful people of those times. Both the novelist and screenwriters have done a great job, creating a credible atmosphere and focusing on different ""ordinary"" persons, not powerful creatures with supernatural forces. Of course, the viewers can recognize various books, sagas and epics of different times and nations, but references, patterns or profiles are not ""modernized"" copies too often available in the U.S. movies depicting ancient or medieval events.

The other strength is the use of different filming locations in different countries, creating a real picture and avoiding intensive use of digital effects. Viewers who have traveled in Europe have nice joy of recognition.

And of course, the cast - from several countries, including character actors from Great Britain, and giftedly chosen child actors. As for personal contribution, the most imposing to me were Sean Bean as Ned Stark, Peter Dinklage as Turion (won Golden Globe for his performance) and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister - a Brit, an American, and a Dane, respectively. But even smaller supporting roles were deliberated and well performed. As for the use of violence or erotica, I cannot agree with them who think it was unnecessary or too much; those thinking so are apparently not good at history :)

For the sake of the best comprehension, you should see all the episodes and preferably more frequently than once a week. And it is better to have a graph of characters at hand as - throughout the series - there are several hundreds of them opening their mouth at least once, and most of the names and places are not easy to memorize either.

Anyway, I am looking forward to the Season 3 already, although it seems that the weight of fantasy/magic increases."
194,"it feels like they really lost sight of the plot for season 5. it just did not have any of the charm, nor many of the incredible sets, costumes, or atmosphere of the previous four Seasons. the character development was weak, the stories didn't feel like they went anywhere, and it just felt like the whole team perhaps is a bit jaded. the writing has suffered, it is just not the same show that it used to be. The characters were not developed much further, and the dialogue got leaden. Not sure where they are intending to go with this, but quite frankly, not sure I want to know. And I loved the first four seasons. I barely feel any motivation for season 6 if there's going to be one. I'm about as excited about that, as the upcoming episode of Star Wars."
195,"The worst show to match one of the worst authors of all time. So unpredictably silly, it's predictably hilarious; what a concept!?!?! His prose (or lack thereof) is horrendous and the funniest thing about the show is that it comes off just as dry and bland as it does in the books. For avid fantasy readers it is insufferable to read and watch the blatant and sometimes subtle literary theft-cover-up-change-a-tad often dished out on the pages. If we were to punish for the crime of literary theft, then he'd be serving a Life Sentence! The show receives at least a star for a so-so cast of actors that try to pull off the impossible and make the story actually interesting and worthy of a bag of popcorn, but in the end the show is not something you'll be binge watching anytime soon."
196,"OK, so I gave this show chance given its rave reviews and very high rating on IMDb. I have to say I love the graphic style and cinematography, watching it all on Blu-ray Disc on a 106"" projected screen in a dedicated home cinema. It is a feast for the eye and ear!

But content?? After mere minutes - before the title sequence of the first episode - I am lost in glowing blue eyes and supernatural crap.

I am sure this show must get its high rating from the amount of exposed lady skin and focus on sex from role-playing acne-be-fest teenage clowns that would normally run around in the (same as in the show?) woods dressed like Kings, Queens and Darth Vaders, and whose only claim to skin must be that they were close to the set when this aired.

It holds absolutely no value to me. I am not interested in seeing sisters and brothers going at it with each other. Or midget sex. If you are an adventure loving clown, be my guest. If you value half a bit of decency combined with just a tiny part realism, stay away.

The only cool piece was when they actually included Prince Charming from Skrek in the form of Jamie Lannister, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. Fit man for the comic role.

Piece of crap."
197,"And that says a lot. After watching the first two seasons my opinion about this show was somewhere between very great and absolutely amazing. It was totally mesmerizing watch with dozens of memorable scenes, but I was still puzzled whether Game of Thrones is on the same level as some of my other favorites like Breaking Bad and The Wire. After season three, I can only say that Game of Thrones blows every other series I have ever seen out of the water.

After the first season I had to pick up the ASOIAF books and blasted through them in one summer. Having seen the first season and how well the book translated to the screen, I was extremely excited yet slightly nervous to see the rest of the story come alive on Game of Thrones. Nervous because the first season already was so well made, I was afraid if the show can keep up with the standard it had set. Not only did it do that, but it just kept getting better! The casting is perfect, the acting is amazing and I simply can't praise this series enough. The story George R.R. Martin wrote keeps you on the edge for every moment of it, and the changes they made for the Game of Thrones have so far been only for the better. It definitely deserves all the hype. I'm feeling awkward writing a review that turns out into a praise, but I simply can't find anything bad to say about it. If there ever were some little mistakes I didn't like, the rest of the awesomeness made me forgot about it as if it never happened. There were few scenes on season three that alone would've made me give this series 10/10. Only thing I can complain about is having to wait a year for the next season. And a year more after that.

I don't think TV series could get any better than this. Except maybe the fourth season."
198,"Can I just start by saying the I am a devoted Tolkien fan. I have not read any of the Game of Thrones(GoT)books, but I am familiar with the debates abound the extent to which TV series do justice to books.

Having just finished watching Episode 9 of the second season, I have to say that this is a seriously amazing series. I appreciate that Tolkien is not for everyone but, my God, GoT has something for everyone without a doubt!

Debates around the faithfulness of the series to the books, is a purely philological discussion with very little value. The series is amazing anyway!

BEST PART: You never know what will happen. No stereotypical story lines driven by shallow characters. And there is always something happening which is an incredible feat.

You have to watch to believe it."
199,"There is nothing about value, art, good acting, good screen play, good actors in this movie. It is enough to watch (maxim.) 30 minutes to understand that, if you are an average person, some intelligent human being with some education and a little good sense. They put together everything is bad in cinema/TV and everything is destroying the cinema in this so-called great movie: endless talking about nothing, bad story, violence and sex without sense/goal , the fantasy is not fantasy, the romance is not romance. Just a room from hell, that room where someone would be tortured with NOTHING. It makes the people stupid. Some terrible mix between a south-American soap opera (telenovela) and a bad, old video game. But this is not enough! They just don't want to stop this error of nature - it makes money, people! Lots of money! It is very hard to find words for this ... thing. If you want to torture an intelligent person, well, you got a perfect tool: The Games of Thrones! This ""movie"" is a lesson about ""how to spend many millions and make the most false thing in the world"". Yes, because over all this and beyond ...thrones an absolute falsity, hollowness. A very bad movie is sometimes funny, relaxing etc. This one is not. This is just one of the most terrible things the cinema has produced in its all history."
200,"For me this series developed in a strange way. The start up was quite interesting. Many characters and relationships to think about. Then some of my most loved characters died but i could deal with it. The story was a good one even so it was not that accurate based on what the books told us. Now something changed when there were no books for the contents base anymore. From that point characters teleported around the world and the timeline fell apart as well as the world. To shrink and enlarge the world and the distances whenever the director likes it is the best way to destroy the experience of the spectators who have a little sense of intelligence. The dialogues went shorter with every episode and the plot line had nothing interesting anymore. It became a bad story with everything shorten or cut out to get it to the end as fast as they can. At the same pace the action increases and the fighting scenes took over everything. Nothing else is interesting anymore.

Sorry but Game of Thrones is a bunch of nonsense fighting scenes right now, nothing more. Deal with it."
201,"This series is just overrated. First and second season story was good (expect the nudity, nudity everywhere part), and the rest of it seasons are just BORING"
202,"To be honest I haven't watched especially many shows in my life, TV has never really been my cup of tea. But I still believe that Game of Thrones has to be the best show airing right now, there is no way that any other show could reach this level of awesomeness.

The best part of Game of Thrones are the characters, although there are so many of them that at times it is hard to remember all their names. However, they are all very unique and the actors portraying them do it really well, it is very hard imagining someone else than Peter Dinklage playing the role of Tyrion.

The atmosphere is very varied during the different parts of the show, we have the political intrigues in Kings Landing, the great battles and the supernatural elements.

Game of Thrones compiles everything great with all the previous fantasy films and shows, mashes them together to form something truly unique. The epicness of the Lord of the Rings franchise and the realism and darkness of Pan's Labyrinth. The fact that it is made for adults is probably its greatest strength when compared to other fantasy shows or movies made in the last 5-10 years. It is not full of CGI, the show is very graphic when it comes to language/nudity/violence and it gives a lot of time for character development.

The show is also very unpredictable, the characters are never far from being killed off, something that separates it from most other shows/movies in the fantasy genre.

I would recommend this series to anyone interested in fantasy, politics or general awesomeness but beware, this is not for the light hearted! Having watched all four seasons, I gladly give this 10/10."
203,"Really this is undoubtedly one of the best shows ever made .. take my word . you wont regret watching it .. even though you feel like killing the writer of the book at times and stop watching the series because of some sadistic episode , you just cant stop it , it leaves you wanting for more...

Right now everyone is impatiently waiting for the next season to come out .. I hope there were more episodes . I finished watching the whole series within just two weeks ...

I really have to say that this show has an amazing cast.. some of the best actors who really deserve a loud round of applause"
204,"Although I am a fan of fantasy stories (LOTR, Earthsea) I must say I have never heard of ""a song of ice and fire"" on which game of Thrones is based. For the moment I am glad I didn't, it makes the series just the more compelling not knowing what comes next, because so far it is one of the best TV series i've ever seen. From the brilliant opening sequence (with Ramin Djawadi's beautiful music) to the great acting, some very memorable evil characters and especially the unpredictability of the story, I for the moment have no clue where it all will end, a bit of the Lord of Rings with a pinch of the Sopranos, very refreshing indeed."
205,"I started watching GOT after Season 3 - I was hooked by Daenerys in Astapor scene. I became a fan of the series and was thrilled and waiting for Season 7.

Stupid plot, mindless decisions of the main characters, Stupidity with capital S. Is this the same Tyrion we know from the previous seasons, I wondered? Daenerys following idiotic plans and advises ...??? Even when she was in Qarth, she wasn't acting so erratic. Huge plot holes - like how fast can a raven fly from North to South? Obviously faster than a military jet according to the time line in Season 7.

Season 7 reminds me of Guy Ricchi's King Arthur movie - you can't believe what you are seeing, checking if you are not in some alternate reality.

I hope the people writing the GOT script take some pointers from my review and rethink the future last season."
206,"Season 1-4 are great and a 93/100 worth.

Season 5 ruined characters and locations from the book for me so i only give it a 23/100

Season 6 was better and had great moments but had bad plots too so i give it a 65/100

Season 7 was just a big FanFiction. Shitty Story, no logic, rushed episodes, bad acting and raped asoiaf

I can only give it a 12/100

This Show give me 4 great seasons, 1 average-good season and 2 really bad seasons. So i am not sure what rating i should give. I just can recommend other people to watching only the Seasons 1-4"
207,Seasons 1-4 were great and had great writing but after that the show just became a mess with bad writing
208,"I have been hearing about it several years but last year I decided to watch since I have already missed all the season of franchise. I had to watch the whole 5 season consecutively in a month in order to comprehend the series.I would say it was spectacular in term of story line,effect, acting and more politics. the only thing that disappoints me is vulgarity and nakedness.overall,when one watch it you feel that somehow you are part of it.those who are looking for some grat effect and fantasies this could be better choice."
209,"Amazing, never been so addicted to a series before, such a thrilling storyline and you never know what is going to happen next! The characters in game of thrones are brilliant, you grow to love some of the characters, and loathe others which one of the main things I love about a good series. The whole story takes place simultaneously over different areas of westeros, and are constantly being priced towards a finally solution, who will claim the iron throne? No one knows! It's such an exciting series because you can't anticipate what is going to happen next. there are many twists, shock deaths and retributions keeping the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the series and in my opinion Game of thrones is the best thing on television at the moment, no doubt!"
210,"This show has almost every possible element to attract fans from all ages. A political drama in a mythical backdrop this show is so captivating and keeps you on your toes the entire time and one keeps asking for more. One won't even realize 50 minutes can get over so fast! The show doesn't necessarily divert from the book, but when it does, one can find it to be a pleasant surprise. Performances. Brilliant. Storyline. Brilliant. The supernatural element is an interesting mix, and surprisingly doesn't disappoint the viewers. Though the cast is enormous and its easy for a fan to forget some characters and minor story lines easily.. a true fan will find that the little things matter and add onto the spice. The show doesn't hold back in any form of nudity (male or female) neither on gruesome and torturous scenes. All I can say is, if you've not watched the show, give it one episode. It's enough to capture your minds and hearts."
211,"I must say this is the best series of its kind, I have never seen something as deep, real, well done as this one.

The argument, music, scene is as best as it can be. There are 2 things you must like to fully enjoy this series. First is medieval stories and the second is mythology. In each case the most enjoyable is the relations between people, and that has no era...

After this you just need to know that: everything you expect to happen will not; every character can become the your hero of the episode; - all types of people are represented in the story and you will know at least one of each kind very well during the various episodes; and the most important, it doesn't mater if you like someone or if you hate them, in a real war everyone suffers and the majority dies.

So, in conclusion, expect a lot of emotions from you side as during each episode you will for sure feel a lot of hate, angry, love and sadness."
212,"A friend recommended this series to me and I have to say I was not to keen but I have a 13 year old son and I thought we could watch it together. Having both played The Elder Scrolls series of computer games, Morrowind, Oblivion and the latest Skyrim ,dragons included, we were both struck as to how similar it was. However it is in every way a superior example of the genre brought to life on the screen. The acting is superb, costumes, sets and CGI all blend seamlessly into a visual feast for the eyes. I would recommend this to anyone who has even a passing interest in this sort of medieval fantasy world. All I can say is HBO better not do a DEADWOOD or ROME and just wander off to pastures new leaving the fans all wanting more.Just wait until those dragons reach adolescence!"
213,"Game of Thrones can't be qualified as a typical TV show. It can be easy defined as an exceptional work made for TV. HBO once again showed us how TV show can be made like the best in movie world. After Sopranos and with Boardwalk Empire they gave us real pleasure and enjoyment in front of TV screens that don't look like TV show, but rather quality long running movies.

I did not read a book that series are based on, but as a freshmen to the theme I can only express true pleasure with this TV show.

The plot breeds in tradition of any medieval fantasy story, reminds me partly on Lord of the Rings with old classic movies scent, like it is Ivanhoe or Robin Hood for example. Also the smell of Merlin and Boorman's Excalibur are strong here.

From cinematography to direction, everything is a first class, and actors are wonderful. Sean Bean is at his best here unlike some movies where he lacks his true potential.

I am kind of impatient to see next season, but I am sure it will be pure pleasure. I can tell you this, after watching such a show and other I mentioned here, you will never again watch at so many TV commercial crap that exist today."
214,"I have resisted watching this show for so long, but I have succumbed to the madness... and I must say that I am entirely mesmerized! I'm someone who prefers comedy to any other genre (mainly because this life is dark enough, so I'd rather have some laughter)... The first episode I saw was S06E09 Battle of the bastards (it was an accident, I was with ""the wrong crowd"") and the next day I was just too intrigued, and mostly baffled, cause I had no idea who's who, etc. Anyway, I never write reviews or anything, but since that day, it took me 7 days (and nights) to watch the entire show (I basically canceled all my plans and went on HBO Go to watch it) and I just had to share my love for this show! P.S. I'm off to buy the books and read them ASAP! (:"
215,"It's always the same every season in got. It happens very little the first 7 episodes and the last 3 is just insane and the viewers love it.

There are so many reviews out there about this so I'm not sure what to add. But what I can add is that GOT really steps up the game for making series. It's so well made and rich in every aspect.

I have longed for a really good fantasy series to follow and GOT is the one series that has been able to fill that gap.

The atmosphere is really good and the acting is flawless. The story captivates you and the love and hate for characters makes you almost like a part of the series itself.

We do not sow."
216,"To start I must say I have read all the story published so far. And I have watched every episode shown so far. In that order. Usually I keep my thoughts to myself, but seeing the last season(4) in TV, I have picked up the quill to express my gratitude to the actor or the person responsible for picking up Mr. Pedro Pascol to play the role of Prince Oberyn Martell. SUPERB!!! I am in awe and that role or acting is a definitive measurement for me. It just surpasses the character I had pictured in my mind by so far, that I am speechless. Unexplainable. And that is in addition to already the excellent acting work (greatest of all time?), performed by Peter Dinklage and Jack Gleeson (whom I suspect everybody watching, are hating). Highly recommend!"
217,"Great series. Better late than never! A series which will be released in-depth of all individuals and one for an identification of a middle age universe.

I love how the author takes you along on a long unpredictable journey into the magical universe where the battle against good and evil plays a large role

Game of Thrones beats all the movies and all series!

To call it a series is almost a shame because it feels like a long incredibly good movie.

I am amazed almost in love."
218,"Have you ever watched a show so good that you try to get your friends to watch it to? Game of Thrones is that show.

Game of Thrones premiered 2011 on HBO and I was lucky enough to watch it then. Usually I don't catch these great shows until they are almost done. Game of Thrones setting is the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and follows struggles between the nobles for the Iron Throne. Ensuing threats continue on in Essos and the North. A main inspiration for the series is from European history including England's Wars of the Roses between 1455-1485. The series delves into Western high medieval Europe. This show is based on books and had a massive budget to start, plus plenty of promotion. The show has been parodied by famous comedians and has a cult following. This will be one of those shows that people will be sad to see end. - Asif Zamir"
219,"Perhaps I'm not being as objective as i could, even then this amazing series is one of the most stunning TV shows, don't know in the future, but right now its possible and probably the best TV series.

GOT haven't point of comparison with other series like breaking bad, homeland, mad men, I'm sorry for those who like this series but they just not as good as GOT, don't matter what the EMMY's says, i like to believe that we already know how the EMMY's usually works for the benefit of just a few. talking about braking bad, or mad men that i also enjoy, are a really good TV shows but also are more popular, made with the objective of make more people to like it without being too risky or controversial, or mature, I know that GOT its some times harder to watch (for some people) because this series wasn't made for everyone, was made to be the best show, something like no other TV show, epic, savage, crude, and surprisingly real in the human behavior, of course attached to a fantasy story with dragons, magic, epic battles, and so many secrets to discover.

I literally don't have all the correct adjectives or words to describe it (english is not my native language) and even if i loose some objectivity rating this a 10 over 10, the great work that all the people involved put in this series deserves no less than a 9 rate in a movie/series rater website, considering that if u give it a 9 that will mean that there is no other series capable to have the same rate.

In all aspect, from technical, sound, video, editing, mixing, direction, cast, actresses and actors, story, plot, script... in every single aspect it's a flawless piece of work.

Just want to say Thanks! to George R. R. Martin for write this great story., and to Emilia Clarke just thank you for existing and being part of GOT.

Thank you to all of you in Game of Thrones."
220,"Game of Thrones is easily one of the best shows on TV at the moment along with Breaking Bad, and is perhaps one of the finest ever. The detail is incredible and every episode is superb. Peter Dinklage is entertaining as are the rest of the cast, but with such great detail into the whole world of Westeros it's easy to understand why every character is so enigmatic and wonderful- whether their evil like the tyrannical King Joffrey or kind-hearted like Emelia Clarke's Daenerys Targaryen. Season 1 is probably it's best so far, but with episodes like 'Blackwater' and 'The Rains of Castamere' each season is assured to be a thrilling watch, worthy of your attention. Any show that can fearlessly kill off some of its best characters and maintain the same level of class like Game of Thrones does deserves attention and this series, despite taking a while to reach a pivotal point, is continually intense and never, ever boring."
221,"As many people have mentioned, it is great to see a book to film adaptation that really stays true to the book. The books are so amazing in their depth, and the complexity of the world was unlike anything I had ever read. In a way it was almost like a dramatized version of a true story. The fact that the series has stayed so close to the books is rather surprising since even books with much simpler stories tend to lose a lot going to film. One thing I find very amusing is that most of the negative reviews that I read (and I read quite a few) were written by people who never read the books. It makes me wonder if they would have hated the books, or just hated the series because they didn't know what to expect, and the story doesn't fit the typical fantasy movie/series mold. ( Let me add that starting a bad review of a fantasy series saying that you hate fantasy stories makes no sense. If you know you don't like something, don't watch it!) Anyway, for a story as complex as this one to be adapted so well as this is a rare thing, and I am very glad to see such a great series of books turn into such a great series on film.

I do recommend that if you are totally new to this series you read the books, or at least the first book before watching the series. While it is not absolutely necessary, I think you will get more out of it, and enjoy it much more."
222,"Now that I just finished the first two seasons I'm seriously surprised. This TV show is truly something to be amazed about! Right now I'm really trying to find a flaw in it but I just can't. I thought of everything, the pacing, the cast, the direction and I even dared to question the amazing production value! But i couldn't find a single main thing, maybe the occasional out of pace scene but nothing to distract you if this amazing journey. Let's start with the plot, it is an adaptation of the famous series of novels A Song of Ice and Fire from George R. R. Martin. Like you guessed I haven't read them but I'll congratulate George for such a deep and rich universe and characters! But you are gonna ask, can this show really pull you into this story and make you like the protagonists? The answer is: ABSOLUTELY! I found myself cheering for Tyrion as he led his forces in Blackwater Bay! I liked hating Joffrey's guts and seeing what other horrible things he could do! And I liked immersing myself in Jon Snow's journey to the mysterious and wild lands that lie North of the Wall! The story is so engaging and it never gets lost in the overwhelmingly big cast of characters. There were a few times where I said ""woah, who was this?"" or ""what was this dudes name?"", but nothing overly complicated. The actors are great, they are full of charm and fit the characters. The ones that really stood out where Peter Dinklage as the smart and cunning Tyrion Lannister, Sean Bean as the honorable and loyal Ned Stark and last but not least, Jack Gleeson, playing the and sometimes chilling Joffrey Baratheon! Another thing I want to talk about is the astonishing and amazingly crafted presentation. It takes you in... no, it sucks you into this world and makes you care about it and feel part of it. I swear every time I see it I just sit back and enjoy my time in Westeros."
223,"By writing this review I know am not adding anything further than what all the other top reviews have said. However I felt the need to spite the terrible narrow-mindedness of the low reviews of this show.

Game of Thrones is another exceptional piece of television produced by HBO. The depth and breadth of the series plot and it's characters is incredible. I've not seen anything as impressive on television since Battlestar Galactica.

If you are having doubts due to the shows minority of naysayers, don't! This is quality entertainment and television as it should be. The writing is gripping, the production values astounding, and the performances by the cast a joy to behold.

If I had only one criticism of this programme is that is TOO GOOD and it is very cruel to make us wait so long for it's further instalments."
224,"Best series I've ever watched. Couldn't be drawn away from watching it. Spent 2.5 days catching up with the series and now eagerly await every episode to come. The characters are well cast and all very good actors. I haven't read the books but I'm going to. I really like a few characters but the thing with George Martin (the author of the books) is that he kills off some of the characters you tend to love which makes you become emotionally attached to the series even more to see how those characters closest the dead one cope! Its like a web full of little links and thats what makes it unique. The storyline is fantastic. I love the fantasy and magical qualities it has. The filming, producing and editing is also fantastic. Its just AMAZING. I'm completely hooked and obsessed! Once you watch there's no turning back, you'll be hooked from start to end of every episode. At the end of each episode you're left with a cliffhanger which then in turn makes you watch the next, and so on. A truly fantastic series and I look forward to every episode!"
225,"I just watched the first two episodes of Spartacus and I am unsure if I want to bother watching any more of that series.

In stark (no pun intended) contrast, I was absolutely captivated by Game of Thrones by the first episode of the first season.

I am pretty critical and up to the latest episode, I cannot say anything negative about Game of Thrones. It sets the bar impossibly high for all TV series. Game of Thrones represents the epitome of classiness, quality, character development, and it has successfully included sex and violence in a manner that is necessary for the story line.

Kudos to all those involved! It is everything that Spartacus is not!"
226,"Finally someone has done it. At last there is a book to screen adaptation that is satisfying for those who have read the book. I actually find some of the characters more engaging than I did when I read the novels. Robb is a good example of this.

Do you like fantasy with: sword-fighting, dragons, magic, politics, good acting, & good writing? If you said yes then watch this as soon as possible. Of course I should mention that this series is not for children. If you have read the books you know what I am talking about.

The production design is great it is great to see places like The Wall realized on screen. Quarth is quite nice as well.

I am quite pleased with the direwolves as well. I was a little worried about how they were going to turn out but they look amazing in the second season."
227,"Words cannot describe how amazing this show is. If you love medieval fantasy and are a huge fan of the ""A Song Of Ice And Fire"" series, this is definitely a faithful adaption.

As mentioned above, the series is based on the fantasy saga ""A Song Of Ice And Fire"" by New York Times bestselling author George R.R. Martin. Each book has reached number one or close to it, respectfully. Set in a world reminiscent of medieval Europe, where winters can span decades, and summers can last a month, noble families vie for the Iron Throne and kingship over Westeros.

The first season is phenomenal, and conveys mostly everything from the first book in the series, ""A Game Of Thrones"". Every actor chosen fits the character so well, you believe they ARE their character. Sean Bean, my favorite actor of all time, is phenomenal is Eddard ""Ned"" Stark, the protagonist of the first book. He conveys the emotions in Ned perfectly, and he the scene where.... Well, I won't spoil anything for you. It is really hard to praise just one actor with this show, as everything feels so believable.

The sets and props are OUTSTANDING. Each weapon, each piece of clothing, has such detail, you just want to pause the show and look at it up close to admire the craftsmanship that went into such work. The sets, beautiful. Northern Ireland and Malta are the perfect places for this show to be filmed in. Every environment looks so natural, and fits the books very well.

Now the special effects for a show with a budget of %50 million or so are.... Honestly, I can't find words to describe how amazing they are. Want to know how real they look? Go to YouTube and search ""Game Of Thrones visual effects"".

If you are a fan of the books of medieval things in general, this show is DEFINITELY worth checking out. Some say it starts off slow, and yes, it somewhat does, but you will NOT be disappointed, since the show is only going uphill from here as it suits up for its second action packed season. Winter is coming, and by the Seven, I hope it continues to stay."
228,"Game of Thrones is a great series, not mainly because of it's great visual effects, fast action and cinematic looks (although those are pretty good too...), but because of it's characters. They are all extremely believable and interesting, they really are the heart of this series. Should those characters be taken away, then everything collapses dramatically, for sure. Almost every line, every moment and every scene is filled with complicated and intriguing emotions and situations. With every episode the characters grow bigger and bigger, creating a realism and depth you rarely see in today's television series. The only thing that i found irritating from time to time was the fact that the environment (and perspective) changes a lot, giving you the feeling of hopping through the world, every time a scene gets really interesting, the camera hops away to another perspective. But that's a detail and doesn't nearly compare to the greatness of this series. I really recommend giving it a chance, you won't regret it!"
229,"HBO did a great job with this show. I was afraid they may not follow the source material (like AMC did with ""The walking dead"") or that their depiction of certain events and people/creatures would suck) but I was pleasantly surprised. All of the cast members did a great job and most of them really fit the characters their were assigned. The production values are excellent, everything looks as if this were a big budget film, it really must have cost them a fortune to make this show. Except for a few (mostly minor) exceptions they were really true to the book and all of the major events were shown with as much detail as they were in the book. However there were some changes I didn't like. The biggest one is the age of the ""children"" (the Starks, Baratheons and Daenerys). Almost every single one (except maybe Arya) is way too old. Rob and Jon are 14 in the books. Here they look to be in their late teens or early twenties. The same goes for Daenerys, she is supposed to be 13, here she looks like 20. In her case it would be somewhat understandable since the producers were probably concerned about showing a 13 year old girl f*cking like she does, but in the case of the boys I see no valid reason for the change, and considering that the events in the books so far span a few years where you see the characters growing older the decision to cast older actors seems rather nearsighted. The biggest age difference is from Rickon (also known in the show as the invisible Stark :P). In the book he is about 2. Here he must be 6 or 7 at least. Another thing I didn't like were the scenes that weren't in the book, like the ones with The Spider and Littlefinger or the homo-erotic scene between Stannis and Loras Tyrell and the ones that are in the book but not in the show, namely the battles. There are only 2 battles in the first book but we only see their aftermath in the show (and in one of them an important fact -certain deaths- is not mentioned). I can understand that this may have been due to a time constraint (they were trying to fit the entire book in a mere 10 episodes) but if it was due to budget constraints one has to wonder what are they going to do in he following seasons? Books 3 to 4 (I haven't read 5 yet) have dozens of battles, some very large (including a naval battle), that are essential to the plot. If they choose to only show their aftermaths that will certainly detract from the show."
230,"Anyone else love the opening credits/theme? The music is perfect, build up is fantastic.

The show - all of the characters are very well chosen --- can I say Holy Crap - this show is good! Just watched the 4th episode, all I can say is a very big Wow. Can't wait for the next - completely blows away any other show running!

Really is surprising how close to the story the show is staying -- virtually no TV show/movie will ever perfectly replicate the experience of such a well written series as this, but -- this is as close as it gets.

I don't watch TV, but I watch this show."
231,"Up until recently I was a big fan of HBO's adaptation of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire, there were minor changes in season four and some very dodgy pieces of dialogue written by the show runners but it now seems they were just testing the waters for something much worse.

I understand that the books themselves have a lot of detail, too much to properly translate onto the screen but the show seems to have gone wildly off the rails, cutting characters and sticking characters where they shouldn't be and throwing out their story arcs. It's all just so two dimensional and boring now, the world doesn't seem to have any depth and the dialogue is absolutely terrible, more to the point events that hold a huge amount of weight (Ramsay, Reek and Fake Sansa) have been removed making one of the cruelest characters in the books seem completely benign.

Boring, I have dropped my score from 9 to 5, It would be lower if I hadn't enjoyed the previous seasons."
232,"I love epic stories set in medieval times. This series definitely has qualities of a great story, original and creative yet not too much where its not realistic. Knights, dragons, princesses, kingdoms, wars,drama this series has it all. The only issue I have with it is the soft porn aspect..its way too much. I am a girl and i guess there are men who beg to differ on my view. Not everyone wants to see two people getting it on or peoples private parts; there are websites and movies for that I don't need it rubbed in my face. There is a way to convey the message without overly elaborating it like the show does.Everyone who has a brain and a history book knows that incest, rape, brothels and indecency was rampant back then no need to amplify it in every other scene.I find TV shows now a days exploit sexuality way too much and its a shame because this show has great potential. I would have given it a 9 or a 10 because the acting,scenery, story line is superbe...too bad"
233,"Surely a few annoying and immensely unlike-able characters, mixed with violence and nudity shouldn't be enough to get this show to a rating as high as Breaking Bad's...

Yet here it is. There's quite a lot of generic 'female empowerment' porn which is why, I assume, the ratings are high. Beyond the ridiculousness of it all, the unreasonable and unrealistic characters, and poor story telling, which I admit, in the first two seasons was just good enough to keep you watching, is a bad show. Only getting worse.

Aside from the dwarf and John Snow, literally zero of the characters have realistic or like-able traits. The dragon b**ch is most annoying. Everything goes her way for most of the seasons, for no reason whatsoever, just because. At least bleach her thick eyebrows.

A certain plot twist where a certain family (some of it) gets killed caught me off guard, I admit, however what simpletons might see as 'great, edgy plot development' just seems lazy to me.

""Let's kill off as many as we can so the script can be easier to write, yet keep saying '9 families' in the promos so it seems like a lot is going on.""

I almost forgot - the little girl with the Needle sword - worst character and worst acting in the whole movie. You gave Hodor one line and even he's less wooden and bland, in fact - much less.

The fighting sequences look too fake, poorly choreographed. Most of the movie is too dark, which isn't the de facto easiest way to set a mood, as some movie directors might be thinking. There's a lot of quiet whispering and mumbling which suddenly shifts to much louder horse sounds, annoying screeching babies or women getting screwed as the next scene beings. Both visually and sound- wise, things shift radically and it's only annoying, nothing else.

Aside for the first two seasons being respectfully capable of keeping you watching, certain things that were said by the dragon b**ch along with everything mentioned above suddenly made me hate this show, as that's when I realized - beneath the CGI and all the money wasted - it's just another generic female-pandering show.

From the comic con panels you can clearly see none of the ""oh so empowered"" female actresses from this show are attached to it, as they're busy patting each other on the backs and being generally arrogant. If the writing didn't portray them as intelligent and ""so empowered at the expense of men"" in the show - all you'd have is simpletons and weaklings crumbling."
234,"a. lacking cohesion : loose. b. lacking orderly continuity, arrangement, or relevance : inconsistent (an incoherent essay) c. lacking normal clarity or intelligibility in speech or thought.

Because this fault appears to have been deliberately built in by the screen writers and producers, possibly in order to extend the number of seasons over which the story is to be run, I can only rate this 3/10.

Without the built in incoherence, this could have lived up to it's 9+ rating.

Certainly the actors deserve as much, as I believe the acting to be superb."
235,"I really wanted to watch this. I really did. And I really wanted to like this.

There is just so much nudity that I am not continuing.

This show seems to have lots of neat and interesting points to it. But I have seen ENOUGH of women's naked body parts. And I simply cannot stomach any more.

Many people obviously don't mind this. But I absolutely hate that what looks like such an interesting show has been cheapened so badly. Some people may call it ""gritty"" and ""realistic."" I find it trashy. You can still imply things are happening without shoving it in your face.

I am extremely irked because I simply love fantasy, and the mythical creatures, political situations, and intricate world makes me want to watch this badly.

But I don't know if I can get through my disgust. I almost turned it off after seeing yet another de-robing of a woman (the second time with this particular woman) with her pointed parts in plain view, while a man proceeded to take advantage of her while she was crying. I mean, this show can stand on its own without all this stuff and still be successful. What is the point of throwing in this trash? Is titillation to draw in perverted viewer counts worth ruining what could otherwise be a very respectable timeless work? I believe that whoever decided to include this was directly, and absolutely, lowering the value of this work.

Anyway, I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I was extremely disappointed.

Additionally, yes there was a fair amount of gore. A lovely intestine hanging out of a freshly sliced man, maggots on a de-gutted deer with a closeup of its head and bloated tongue, be-headings with pretty views of the red neck meat. Ugh. It was not as bothersome as my prior complaint, but I don't have too much of a problem with gore. Also it wasn't as frequent.

With so many positive ratings, I feel that my viewpoint should be put out there."
236,"No spoilers I find this show entertaining enough to watch, but I don't understand the hype. probably because a lot of fans of the books like it and think it's true to the authors words. But, I never heard about it, so I started watching fresh and to be honest, it took me about 3 episodes to get into it. I had the feeling I was watching a mediocre acting crew of a mediocre story from a soap opera in the middle ages. I think it's fairly well made, the settings are nice a lot of the times, but that doesn't make it an outstanding series. Sean Bean is good in his role, but he's born for these kind of parts. But the rest, well, sorry to say, it's just mediocre acting and a very thin storyline, even not always edited very well. a 7 for the way it is visually brought and the fact that it did entertain me enough to sit the 10 episodes trough, but for the rest I think it's overrated."
237,"I was waiting to be able to watch Sean Bean in something like this since the Return of the King. Now seeing him in such a great series as the protagonist is simply delightful.

Apart from the great acting and setting, I haven't watched a series with so many interesting characters for a long time. You are immediately engaged in their stories, hating the bad guys to their guts, and know the good ones won't have it very easy.

In such a well-written story, every episode is watched like a movie. One week is too long to wait for the next one.

I highly recommend this show."
238,"The producers of this series have, so far, done a spectacular job. As a fan of the books (yes, I've read them all), the visual depictions of the characters and the scenery are spot-on with with how I had imagined they would appear (except Jamie Lannister and I don't know why!). However, I am amazed at the popularity of this series. I say this because, as I watch each episode, I couldn't imagine anyone truly being able to follow the storyline unless they've read the books. There is such a mountain of internal dialog and details that are not conveyed by film -- which is true with most book-to-film renditions. Watching the series after having read the books makes for a highly entertaining experience. George R. R. Martin is, without a doubt, a master of his craft. If not, THE master of his craft. 'Genius' and 'masterful' are the words I use to describe Martin's masterpiece of literature {and film}.

The HBO series should easily be enjoyed on its own merit, but I highly recommend that everyone read the books before watching the series -- it will greatly enhance the experience."
239,"The acting is excellent, the character casting is perfect to hold true to the books.

The story is a bit fast, but anyone who has read the books will tell you that it was a bit confusing reading them too. Martin creates a very complicated world, and there are avid readers of the books, who still wonder what the heck is going on even after reading the books.

There is no clear cut explanation for a lot of things, and a lot of things happen as they might have really happened, not as the audience would predict them. And I promise, not as Hollywood would normally do them. That's why this project is so big, and unique.

Without spoiling, I will say that this story is extremely unpredictable, and a lot of that comes from the confusion that Martin creates. In the end, you will fall in love with some characters, hate others, and misunderstand some more.

But when it's finished, if it sticks true to the books, you will feel VERY rewarded for having tuned in.

--------

This series seems to really separate people :)

All the ""I hate this, girls are exploited, and it's crap"" people are being absolutely hammered by fans. Book readers ALL love it. I have not seen a single bad book reader review, anywhere, so far, ever. What book has ever been put to big screen, where 100% of the readers absolutely love the transition? Never. Ever. Until this.

And mostly, new watchers, are intrigued, and loving it.

Finally, a series that makes the ""I'm so important what I say should matter even if I'm just looking for bad things to create controversy"" people, have met their match.

Martin for President!!"
240,"I doubt even the author of the books knows. He's still slated to finish the final two books of this saga in the near(?) future. There's no doubt they have a huge budget with all the great talent that's on the show, but sadly, they lack the proper writing to match. The plot is spread too thin, the dialog is uninspired and at times hard to watch. If the dramatic speeches sound familiar to you, it's probably because you've heard it before. My biggest problem is the lack of character development. They're all so full of irrationality and contradictions, it makes their motives contrived and their actions hard to justify. It's all so childish."
241,"Those are the words that describe this show very accurately. This also indicates what kind of people could possibly watch and like this show. A simple example, one of these 10 stars reviewers suggest that if you give this show 1 or 2 stars, it means you have no brain cells. So according to this "" genius "" , if you give this show a 10 star, you are brilliant, super intelligent bordering on prodigy. This does not only proves that those reviewers have a way below mediocre intelligence as well as they are extremely immature as they cannot even stand different opinions. They, hopefully, will learn to respect other people's opinions when they grow up. Sadly there is nothing can be done for their "" super high "" intelligence. If they would watch Fellini or Antonioni films, they would know what i mean but then again, i bet they have never heard of these brilliant directors let alone watching their works.

Graphic violence, accompanying with gore, in this is used for cheap thrills with no real reason.

Sex and nudity are abundant , gratutious, contrived and forced merely to attract those who have brains way below where it actually should be.

Rape is extremely trivalised, normalised, eroticised and glorified. Writers even put some rape scenes that do not exsist in the books. There is no adverse effect shown on rape victims let alone making them seek justice or revenge. One can say this is medieval age but it is not. there was not any dragon in this age. This is merely a fiction and they depict sexual assault and rape as if it is nothing and a form of sexual relationship.

What most stroke me is that some of these so called "" actresses "" defend those to death. I know that actors and actresses are not the most intelligent sort but this is too much, even for actresses and actors.

One of them say that nudity is integrated within story. Well, no, when tits, p****** and butts are floating around, nobody cares what kind of point you are trying to make as all focus on these female meat. Whatever emotion or message you are trying to convey is lost in the female flesh. If there were such a technology that can track gaze on the screen, thenit'd be obvious that tits, butts and p****** wpuld be most visited parts in these scenes and nothing else matters as soon as you show nudity and sex.

Another actress say that people criticise her showing tits and such but they do not criticise violence , blood or when heads blown off. Lol This actress somehow believe that nudity and violence can be exchangeable and it is not. Also one can be against both gratutious nudity and excessive violence at the same time which never occurs this actress. Moreover, many people do not only ciriticise gratutious nudity and sex but these very same people also criticise violence. If this actress is so uncomfortinle of on screen violence, then why didn't she quit the show? She didn't, she won't because of only one reason, money.

That very same actress also claims that you cannot have sex with bra in real life. Well, yes you can if you don't have some sort of anatomical abnormality. Yes, usually women take off their bra but not always, especially outdoors. This actress wnat sto say that sex and nudity happen in real life and we merely reflect this. Then again, we do not see any penis or vagina or will this actress claim that people have sex without a vagina and penis?

In the terms of filmmaking, no nudity is ever required or necessary. It is only necessary for ratings, profit and money because nudity and sex sell. Producers and directors force actresses to disrobe themselves so that they could gain money and fame. Actresses show their tits , p**** and butts for the very same reason. Audience, mainly consisted of males, want to see female bits, thus it is a win-win-win situation. The only thing loses here filmmaking.

Another actress claim that those nude scenes are artfully done, Lol. It is always the case, always integrated with the story, artfull, trusted directors, real life resemblances etc. etc. etc. Well, any and every woman have these "" arts "". I show my tits, look at my ass and pussy, see my art? What a great artist i am !

Another one claims that it is part of acting, meaning, you are not a real actress if you do not show your tits, ass and pussy. Then Ingrid Bergman, the best actress ever lived, and countless others were not a real artists because they never shown their bits, lol.

I wish those actresses could have been honest and say that they do this just taking the role and eventually for money. This is why i respect porn actresses more than those so called "" actresses "". At least porn actresses are honest at what they do.

Of course GOT is not alone when it comes cheap thrills through violence and nudity. There are countless other tv shows and films use the very same tactic such as Spartacus, Vikings, The Deuce, Girlfriend experience etc. etc. etc. That's the trend nowadays in tv and cinema. Throw tits, p******, gore, violence towards audience, then write a cheesy plot, you are good to go. The more excessive those are, the better response, box office and money you get.

Esme Bianco was showing everything she got almost in every scene she was in. She was wondering around star nakedly all the time. Then one day, she decided to not do any more nude scenes because she did not want to be known as mere tits and pussy but rather as an actress. What did the producers do? Well, they fired her, Lol. If you do not show your flesh, you have no place in this show, or most of the cable tv shows. Talk about gratutioussness.

One may think i am religious and prude but i am not at all. I am even atheist. I'm merely talking about explotation, objectification of female flesh and filmmaking. Anyway."
242,"Game of Thrones is an intricate and interesting story that thrives off of shock, titillation, and disgust. It brings out the worst of human emotions within the characters and is a poor influence on the minds of its watchers (people who mostly just want an epic fantasy). The attention that this series has gained is an unfortunate reflection on our society. While I can understand the allure of such an expansive world with many amazing qualities of a good fantasy, I cannot personally support a series that makes light of nudity, women, rape, and violence. My rating is for the quality of the story as well as the cinematography. I hope that people everywhere will recognize the effects that this series has on their thoughts and emotions as they become immersed in this filth. I also hope that parents will recognize the importance of avoiding bringing these sorts of influences into the home."
243,"Firstly a confession - I hated this TV series so much that I only made it to the end of episode 6 before I gave up - I figured if I couldn't be won over in six hours it was probably never going to happen. Given this fact the reader should be aware that some amazing transformation may have taken place later which make this series far better than I am giving it credit for - though everyone I've spoken to who likes the series thought it was great from the start so I'm guessing the quality (or lack of it) is pretty consistent throughout. My objections? Firstly the writing is terrible - characters speak in this strange and special 'fantasy genre' dialogue which is stiff and comic (when it's not supposed to be) - the series looks cheap and nasty too - sets are often clearly studio bound with weak design, poor lighting and a strangely dated feel - it looks like a 1970/80s BBC Shakespeare production a lot of the time. The series also takes itself far too seriously - the whole thing has a portentous quality and apparently fails utterly to recognise its own silliness. I have absolutely nothing against the fantasy genre - the LOTR books and films are great - but this is a weak addition and I'd recommend avoiding it."
244,"It is an amazing show in many perspectives and I can see why people loves it. I did to. The show started awesome but a bit into the second season pace began to fade. In season three, it was obvious: Inspiration for Daenerys Targaryen must come from Moses' 40-year wandering in the desert home to Israel from Egypt. I have completely lost interest in the series, although I'm impressed by the production and all the actor's efforts. The series has produced many exciting characters and let viewers get acquainted with many new promising actors / actresses. Veteran actors has popped up to the surface again and proved their greatness. Game of Thrones has lots of qualities and the series has in many areas outperformed everything else that has been shown on television before ... but ... the lethargic pace sucks the will to live out of me. Sure, things happen... people are dying and the new ""wild cards"" are thrown into the game. The problem is that it does not feel as if it matters. I'm not against the drama part but it feels like the awesome entertainment is suffering from drama being to stretched out and not leading anywhere. The series has not reached its end yet so my review is not engraved in granite but I no longer following series after the 4th season. Likely I'm going to see the rest when the entire series available on iTunes or similar. I rate it 5 stars because it at this point bores me. Who knows? Maybe I will restore the 10 I gave the show after season one after I seen the last episode?"
245,"Murder. Dragons. Murder. Nudity. Oh, did I mentioned murder? That's pretty much it. This is what this series is about. And I watched Season 1 and 2. It was horrible and I'll never get this time back. What's the matter with this generation? The hype surrounding this series scares me a lot. No sympathy at all, no memorable characters (because they all die right before they do or say anything memorable). The one and only thing I liked is the camera work. One of the saddest things is to see so many great and talented actors in this senseless series. I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed that this kind of series is so popular. So otherwise I would recommend to stay away from the series - now after watching the whole season - I 'd say : get the f outta here!"
246,"Eccellent up to season 4, in season 5 we see something going bad but overall was still a great series. Season 6 was kinda meh but its season 7 that has orribly ruined this masterpiece. Overall 7 average between 10 and 4 (first part and second part)."
247,"Peter Dinklage and Charles Dance...absolutely brilliant, My boys kept on at me to watch this show for a few years so I obliged by sitting down and watching episode 1 of Season 1. A week later I had got through to the end of Season 4. I am just about to watch Season 5. I have to say this has been one of the best TV shows I have ever watched. I cant emphasis enough the brilliant acting of Peter Dinklage who for me absolutely steals every scene..with the exception on occasions of Charles Dance. The CGI is fantastic and the action sequences are excellent. It took me a while to fathom out who was who with all the Names/Houses etc but once I got my head around them it was brilliant."
248,"I have not read the books, A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, nor have I watched the show live from the beginning years, but I had heard good things and a lot of hype about Game of Thrones, so I thought, as a fantasy and medieval type fan, I would check it out. And boy, am I happy I did!! From the very first episode and particularly about midway through the first season, I was totally hooked onto this show.

Now, you learn pretty quick the mood and tone set by this show. I am a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings and to a lesser extent the Chronicles of Narnia, but this show, even though at times feels like those, is really anything but. It has a much darker, meatier edge to it, sometimes almost feeling too intense for some people. Due to this, it will certainly not be a show that will please all audiences, but for others, it will make what is great about this show, the unpredictability.

What makes this show so special though is the story of all the characters, the sets, and the writing. Also, when I say all the characters, I mean ALL the characters as there are at least 20 characters that you will know by the time you have caught up watching the show thus far. Though its very complex and sometimes can feel hard to keep up with every character's story, the show does a brilliant job at balancing all the character's off that you feel like you know each and every one individually. The dialogue between the characters feels fresh, intense, and just down right gritty. But its this dialogue that keeps you focused throughout every scene. The cast also is simply incredible led by Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, Emilia Clarke as Daenarys Targaryen, Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister and Maisie Williams as Arya Stark. Again, with all the characters, that is only a select few, but others are just as deserving of these accolades.

I personally caught up with the show in just under one week watching, as I absolutely did not want to stop watching, wondering what would happen next in the revolving story as your feelings towards characters change, and characters you grow to love suddenly have things, let's just say, don't go quite the right way for them.

I am not going to compare it to other classic shows of the past, as I have never been the biggest television watcher. But all I can say is that even though this show has a lot of things that are quite intense in the form of violence, language or nudity, it doesn't ever feel like its the focus as the real themes here are family, politics, and loyalty. It's an experience to watch each and every episode, and I can't wait to continue on the journey with all these characters. As Daenarys says most notably in one scene: DRACARYS!!!"
249,"Okay so I'll start by saying that this programme is not something I would normally watch.... I first came across ""Game of Thrones"" when someone posted on their Facebook page that they were watching it. I then looked it up and it had such a good rating on IMDb I decided to watch it myself. I went to my local TESCO and found season 1 and purchased it. I didn't think I'd be much into it, but after half of episode 1, I found myself hooked. I feel the same way after every episode. I wan't more and more and more. I've just recently purchased season 2 and plan to start watching it very soon..... IF YOU'RE READING THIS AND HAVEN'T SEEN GAME OF THRONES YET.... WATCH IT!!!!!!"
250,"After personally reading each book, the Game of Thrones series was incredulously close to the works written of in the books.

The author is an incredibly talented writer and the dramatisation regards the stories told with the precision of a sniper. Screenplay adaptations are very hard to make, especially those done properly and the only other fantasy work of art that has been produced correctly, in my opinion was 'The Lord of the Rings'.

'Martin's books evoke a powerful image within the reader's mind about the transcending story and the screen play adaptation was true to the novel's idea's and story. Great praise to all cast and crew especially Mr Benioff and Mr Weiss for the work of art on-screen. Special thanks to Peter Dinklage who added a brilliantly comic performance to his own role.

Definitely dying to watch the next series unfold."
251,"Wow!!! This is a series you won't regret watching, it was amazing from start to finish, each episode was superb. When GoT aired on Sky Atlantic here in the UK I couldn't watch it because like 60% of the population I don't have Sky TV but another digital TV provider.

But I am so glad I made the effort to watch this online. I was hooked and spent three days watching the whole 10 episodes last month. This lead me to buy and read all of the books released so far. I am eagerly awaiting season 2 and even though I've read the books it wont diminish my pleasure as I know the producers can and will do justice to this epic tale.

Thank you HBO, well done and please don't stop until George RR Martin writes the last book and you have delivered us the entire story, I look forward to a few years of good TV."
252,"I started watching Game of Thrones on Saturday night, I got to episode 10 last night (Tuesday) and am going to watch from episode 1 again tonight, to say this is the greatest TV show ever made is no hyperbole, it's exciting, looks beautiful, is witty and sly, sneaky, scary, heart pounding and all a little familiar.

The acting is amongst some of the best on screen, the characters developed, deep, real feeling and mortal, they plot and grasp and try and die, I really am totally enamoured with this amazing story of amazing people.

The intrigue is dialled up to 11, the sets make me gasp that a TV show is making them, the style is so enriching that you always know where you are from the walls or the people.

Watch, enjoy, thank yourself and HBO for being amazing."
253,"I'm no fan of history shows, whatever type it be. Yet i do enjoy this show. And that's no little thing, especially when it be coming from a startrek/stargate addict. It's purely fictional, yet it ressembles Middle Age England. I admire screenplayers and actors for using a pretty strong language sometimes, yet i have no criticism on that, i believe it makes the show more real. Truly brits. I wish i had a detailed map of the Realm and a genetic map of all the characters. There are so many distinct characters, sometimes is hard to keep track on who's related to whom. I don't know why IMDb.com is forcing me to write at least 10 lines of text on this subject! If i'd write 10 pages on it, it still wouldn't be enough. You just have to watch it for yourselves!"
254,"First few seasons were tremendous, recently D&D have dropped the ball and let it roll around in a pile of sh*t. Each new episode is consistently disappointing.

This could have been something great, now it's just something popular.

There's not much more I can say, we'll all watch it anyway, just don't expect it to be good."
255,"At First I gave this series 10 out of 10 and was happy with it. Show started strong and the at the end of 1st season I was really angry when they killed NED like they did!! But it was OK I mean I was waiting to see some pay back as they(Wolf and company) were no sheep, Wolf will hit back somehow. Following season was some more disappointment in terms of my aspirations lol(Robb dead and others in following season -Oberyn, stannis etc). Well still there were some sparks that made me feel that there is still some hope and things will change but NO!!! There are so many reasons people liked the show at First but then the way it is going I really don't want to watch that. Bran and Arya Stark is left who are very young and Sansa I hate that girl lol, I wish they killed her instead!! Tyrion is a very good and interesting character who is left other than Starks. But rest all i was rooting for are dead. Not that its anybody's fault or am blaming them for anything but I don't want to watch a TV show and get angry every time at the end of every season and wait to get furthermore disappointment. Only few things to enjoy and many things to annoy is the crux of this Series!!! I don't care about that Dragon born girl Dany, or other lannisters, or Tyrells and other such kind of houses. Devious and cheaters do win but not all the time! SO something is wrong here. It has tuned into those kind of shows which are so sad all the time and joyful rarely. I am not a hater but they took my joy away and I really don't like Game of Thrones now. Am not here to watch cersie and Tyrells playing house, or Bolton Bastard doing tortures and stuff. Dumb night watcher killing Jon snow. Its so sad every time this series progresses. Some people might like that kind of stuff but I will rather play counter strike or Football or listen music. Anyway I posted this so if anyone just don't wanna see good guys die all the time over and over They can read this and stay away lol :P"
256,"Great series , Daenerys Targaryen love her strong woman ."
257,"Since season 5 , everything is rushed , empty dialogue , only the special effects are making it worth to watch , hope its gonna change."
258,"Game of thrones is one of those TV shows which I swear will still be considered a pinnacle of television entertainment 50 years from now. And we will tell our grand kids of the sweet torture we undergo every year for a decade waiting for a season of GOT to start.

* Great acting, good plot, amazing CGI,beautifully choreographed battle scenes,picturesque sets from all over the world, carefully detailed costumes and crazy plot twists. What more can you ask for?"
259,"This is easily the best show on TV at the minute possibly ever. Most unpredictable amazing show I've ever seen. The first season starts rather slow as its mainly character introductions but stick with it it takes a while to learn everyones name but you'll get used to it. It doesn't really pick up in action till around episode 6 so i recommend you give the entire season a chance by the end of it you'll be hooked. I've never given a 10/10 to anything but this show comes closest. Season by season there all pretty solid each season seems like a different show due to the large storyline changes. Game of thrones has some top class actors such as Sean Bean, Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Charles Dance, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and many more i constantly recommend this show to everyone i know and everyone loves it."
260,"The show has brought in some of the most talented children i have ever seen. They are much better actors than a lot of stars today. It deals with real life conflicts, following George Martin's masterpiece. It is a production that you know that they've worked on from the bottom of their hearts. They want to surprise you more. This is one of the most talked about shows in the world, yet the cast and crew always have a sense of improving. They give more and more every season.

The only downfall of this show is the presence of some boring episodes. However, these episodes are essential to get the story going. The only thing that i found that some find extremely appealing which others find as a huge turn off is the presence of dragons. But the thing is, those dragons aren't just added for the sake of it. They incorporated well into the story. Plus, the cgi team is working brilliantly on them."
261,"I felt the need to add my two cents simply because of the (somewhat few) negative reviews posted on IMDb. The only criticism I can accept is the fact of much female nudity, compared with no full frontal male nudity, a strange yet common phenomenon not in any way limited to this series.

Other than that, GOT is what so many others have accurately described: possibly the most beautifully filmed, addictive TV show ever produced. The acting is simply superb, on all levels. This is one show that could be truly described as having an ensemble cast, and to that end, no actor/actress seems to outshine the others. All are excellent and seem to truly understand their character's motivations. I have also read the books which were truly fantastic, although at times long. I could not even have imagined it possible that a TV show could be so true to the books and yet almost exceeding the quality of the books. The few plot variations from book to show tend to make sense in terms of making the series watchable and in light of the time restrictions for each season.

The people responsible for casting show really deserve a lot of credit. I am absolutely blown away by how well each character is translated to the screen and which actors are chosen for each part. In addition, as other reviewers have noted, the production values and special effects are second to none.

Of course, a lot of people die in the show and I was sad to that Sean Bean had only one season. But, oh, did he make good use of it! I'm sure everyone has their favorites, I personally think the actors who play Lord Baelish (Littlefinger), Lord Varys and Stannis Baratheon are just amazing. But then, who isn't, on GOT?

Ultimately, the real reason for the brilliance of this series is some truly unforgettable moments. So many movies and TV shows are enjoyable, but I end up not thinking much about them after they have ended. Not so with GOT. I laud the producers for taking it seriously enough to produce a truly meaningful, important work of art. There will always be haters and naysayers, I am glad that so many people appreciate this show. Thanks HBO, for making me so happy!!!!"
262,"This is the best show on TV today. It may be the best show in the history of TV series'. It is definitely not for everyone. The sexual content and violence alone will turn a lot of people away. If you can handle this part then you're in luck. Get ready to go on a thrill ride. Emotional, exciting, intelligent and tragic. This show really has it all. One warning is not to fall too much in love with any particular character or dynamic. Nobody is safe when playing the Game of Thrones. And with a tag line like ""All men must die"", well you get the picture by now. Amazing Actors, Amazing sets, Amazing filming locations. This show is...Amazing. Enjoy!"
263,"After watching till S04E08 I want to tell all Book readers & Non-Book readers,

Don't talk against ""Game of Thrones"". I know that ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is way way better than the show. There is no doubt about that. But can you imagine 20 million people reading 10 chapters of book at a same time and talking about it. No.That is no way possible. So this show has given opportunity to enjoy this EPIC story together. We should be grateful for that. GRRM himself said that ""It's like my dream come true."" I'm also angry at unnecessary changes from book but prefer to let it go."
264,"Puff, were to start from?!

I watched approx. 10.000 movies and about a hundred of TV series, the modesty I know, I know... anyway the reason i write this review is to share with you all my thoughts...

Some of you may like it some of you may not, it's a free world and I respect you choice ! If some of you will say it's a matter of taste I support you guys too. Anyway again that being said lets start:

THE ""GAME OF THRONES"" ... (background music: angels singing Halleluiah)

The STORYLINE is absolutely epic, the strength point of this series is that the intrigue levels are so deep you need a big flowchart or a map to fully understand how the characters evolve, involve, interact, disappear, experience the unknown and so on, i can take any of the characters and subtracts lots of connections with other characters, and this web of intrigue levels makes this Series a gamble. A gamble in what sense, well this complex net makes an Achilles weak point, if the director of this film would not make a good directing, all this complex relations between the characters will fall over his work and BOOM, disaster! Is like building a space ship for the first time or so, you want the reach the stars but you have to think to 1000 things on every step, that's challenging and i respect the director for his work, Good Job !

Characters, a very good acting skills, they are not flawless, but i think everyone contributes to this grater good, the good of the film, and overall they do a wonderful job. I like and think the idea of the undead, to be more specific the frozen undead, to be an Blizzard Idea from the Warcraft I guess (only a thought). It's a bit bloody in the actions and wars but hey it's a damn realistic for that era. Good costumes, acceptable CGI(dragons are a bit Celisse), but hey overall captures you attention fully. Mystical symbols, raven , trees, wolves, swords of some material and so on, makes the series catchy and easy to remember. I think people are very susceptible to this sort of symbols and like them, as a marketing view point its the smart choice that adds commercial value to the movie although i personalty think its kinda silly.

I will not spoil anything, maybe some of you haven't see all the series, but i liked the acting of Theon Greyjoy (very good acting skill).

Sounds and music are very carefully selected and it matches perfectly the mood of the series every episode. I personally don't like the long intro but, I can pas over it. I like the fact that conversation generally doesn't stack over the background sounds, this is a simple and a clean idea which i appreciate, it shows that your attention should be focused on the conversation, and every conversation adds value and new meaning on the evolution of the characters and the story.

Things I don't like: 1.Long intro, damn it's long start already i want to see... (I think every time i look at new episode) 2.Dragons, raven, rituals, and other smoked symbols (Celisse my opinion) 3.Lack of big and more open spaces (usually fields, castles and sea)

Things I like: 1.Acting 2.The stories and scenes 3.Characters, lots of races and types, complex connection between them 4.Sound and music pops the interest 5.Everything else.

If you have another opinion feel free to get the f__k off! :)"
265,"I usually do not review television series' until the end, because anything can happen, but I've been tempted for a very long time with this masterpiece. My God, I have never went through so many emotions during a show. This show is the top of the cake for me and Breaking Bad is second... Which is bad, because that isn't even on the cake compared to how amazing this show is. A great TV show has characters you are interested in and a story structure that doesn't get old. Game of Thrones takes that bottom-line goal of all TV shows and exceeds to the max with characters you genuinely believe in. You love some to death, you hate some with a passion, you feel bad for some, and overall... You care what happens to these fictitious people. That is what's important. Since, George R.R. Martin is such a fantastic, twisted writer he knows how to create amazing characters. We're introduced to many throughout the series and they all bring a story that somehow circulates into the main plot. It seems like shows like Walking Dead tries to mimic that, but it doesn't work for me, because there are many characters on Walking Dead I do not care for. Both series have something obvious to expect between them. And that is death. At any moment in both shows, anyone can die. With Walking Dead, you would be upset if a few die. The rest could die and it's whatever. The plot not even change. With Game of Thrones, every death is a blow, because you have time to really get to know these people. The plot spins out control with each death. That is quality television. Television is the only medium where you can truly capture a character's growth without it being too rushed or too slow. Game of Thrones really uses that to its advantage. Everything that's good about this show is that it takes the advantage of being a show that can last years and it is shot and presented like a damn movie. There's a reason it's the most pirated show in history. It is literally the perfect show. To think, the two producers that started it really didn't have any experience with television or film and they are doing such a wonderful job. If that's not inspiring, I don't know what is."
266,"I held out on Game Of Thrones for quite some time for a few reasons..If I had read the novels , I most likely wouldn't have (to be completely honest , medieval fantasy fiction has never really been my thing).. George RR Martin may have just changed all of that...

The show has stricken a chord with some folks, which just lends it even more credibility if you ask me..It is brutal. beastly . revolting. disgusting and heartbreaking. it's also beautiful , spirited, uplifting, soulful and inspirational..watching it is an experience- one that seems to resonate. this show does , in a way, what Breaking Bad is also doing for me - engaging me in such a way that I revel in what is my own sense of what it is to be human..and needless to say, I am entirely invested in the characters - which leaves me even further in suspense, as NOBODY is safe!

The casting team and the acting crew also deserve props for this one as well.. With the exception of just a few independent scenes , the acting is superb..it would really easy to chew up the scenery , yet they walk the line extremely well. The production is , of course, outstanding. Everything from costume design to the invention of the languages used was well prepared and executed brilliantly.

It is a bit ironic to think of how skeptical I was of the show , given my initial reluctance to sit down and watch it, and now, how much I enjoy it . Matter of fact, I don't think I could trust a person who has watched three episodes and does't thoroughly enjoy it!"
267,"This show hasn't been that great since they killed off Barristan Selmy.

It kind of exemplifies how the writers care more about satisfying the 'shock value crowd' with surprise character deaths, than maintaining character consistency or interesting dialogue. Whether it be a close up of a penis with warts, the half dead Mountain raping a nun, or an Ed Sheeran cameo, the show is just kinda 'meh' now."
268,"This series,is such a huge success because it deliberately revives and confirms male patriarchal stereotypes and general nihilistic views on masculinity.In a time where young men have lost their sense if purpose;what is it nowadays to be a man?This is medieval times recreated with more war and more nihilism.The fantasy element is added with 3 dragons and a little bit of magic. Next to that the deliberate creation of (by now quite boring repetitive predictable (with a""k"") shock effect every season by showing the hacking of heads and limbs""See guys; in days of old real men showed no mercy.""And next to that a cast of almost all unlikable opportunistic characters.Only Jon snow I'd blow:)But who wouldn't? With the Mother Of Dragons joining in of course,o.k boys?:) Certainly most the closeted IMDb gaming nerds that adore this show so,would join.Those that seem to have kidnapped the sf- fantasy ratings of IMDb anyway:)Oh yeah.. Diana Riggs Oleana Tyrell is somebody I would have a cup of tea with. Anyway I digress.Next to that the psychology is very flat.Because most of these types are vile,disrespectful, not so sensitive twats (m/v) whom we frankly, as the seasons progress, get no true insight into; motivation wise.Why care?Problem is there are too many characters in the first place.And they all seem to have the same bloody hollow ambitions. As of yet our dear writer has not granted us any solace any hope of any sort of psychological release.And we're in season 6 of 7, mind you, of mister Martin's ""provocative"" nihilism; I say why don't they just all butcher each other! Which they probably will in the end ! See if I care!.:) It's all gone much too far without having anything significant to say about humanity.Whilst fantasy should provide us with alternative views and values.And could really blow our minds.Here it merely serves to confirm the hopelessness of the man race:) In short:Overrated by IMDb gaming computer nerds and South Park loving autistic sissy boys that do not know where to stick it anymore:)All a bunch of vagrant crybabies that wouldn't even be able to handle a sword,They'd probably hack of their own toes.Fitting actually:) Toodles.....:)"
269,"If you ever struggle to sleep at night what this series.. iv made it my routine to watch an episode before i go to sleep and it works wonders. Forget using sleeping tablets or having a glass of having a whiskey.. simply watch an episode and you will be lights out by the time it finishes. How it gets such a high rating i will never know! People get caught up in the hype. Its terrible, simply terrible! Do not waste your time!!!"
270,"I'm just going to say it: Game of Thrones is a grossly, grossly, GROSSLY overrated series. People act like this is one of the greatest series ever made. I say that's bullshit! Game of Thrones is so f*cking boring. The plot lines are everything we've seen in this type of story before. Every episode feels formulaic. It drags along often. The acting is subpar. Sometimes the actors seem more interested in the money they are about to get than the roll they are portraying. Other times they are WAY overacting to where it just gets annoying. The set design, while nice looking, is still generic as all hell. It is the same forest and ""mythological environments that we've seen in Lord of the Rings or Princess Bride. I cannot believe this lasted more than a season and has a rating of a NINE POINT F*CKING FIVE on IMDb! It's not the worst show ever but it should not be grouped with shows like Breaking Bad. Oh, and did I mention that the fanbase is almost as bad as the bronies?"
271,"The question is not why we would watch such shows as why they would make them. They may simply want to test the limits of the art of film/show making. Perhaps they foster serious discussions of difficult subject. In my opinion, they are simply not worth the price of the film stock they are printed on. Arty crap is still crap. Don't waste your time on this. This is the kind of sick, nausea--inducing garbage that the said crowd, especially Westerners. This was probably the worst piece of cinema I've encountered, considering its very thin and simplistic plot, shadowing the disturbing atmosphere of very sinister subjects which were specifically, incest, rape and murder. The people who made the show and watch the show are just sadly very sick humans. This show is immoral, perverted and completely filthy. I watched the pilot and I felt so dirty and disgusted; all I saw was meaningless sex, degrading women, incest, perversion and extreme violence. Where have our morals gone to allow shows and movies like this to be so popular??? I don't like fantasy stuff and this show is just the worst I have EVER seen, I can't understand why so many people like it. It's just horrible and annoying, I hate it! First time I saw it I almost puked, the characters were so annoying and even the main characters died, what is this show even about - Death and war? I mean the actors are so emotionless and boring, you can see that they hate to work for this TV show. I mean seriously it's the first time I saw this show and I already hate it, how is this even possible without sucking so much? Who is the audience that likes this show, who? Nerds and WoW-Players, I mean seriously why do people watch this when there are so many better shows Pure filth!!! 0/10"
272,"Game of thrones is and will be the best show ever made in the history of television. The mere commitment of the show runners to give their audience the best possible viewer experience is really commendable. The way each character unfolds and how well the plot is spun around these characters is simply admirable. This is the only show worth waiting for after completion of every season. And mind you, it does deliver every time that it returns for the new season. I just hope i get to watch many such shows in future."
273,"""Lannister, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell, they're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top and that one's on top and on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground. We're not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel."" -Daenerys Targaryen

Rating this show anything less than 10/10 is an injustice. This show transcends all of its predecessors across all mediums. GOT is in a league of its own."
274,"Even if you don't watch ""Game Of Thrones"" chances are you have probably a lot of friends who watch it and say that it is the best show that they have ever seen, and can't stop telling you about it. Well i say that too, because i haven't seen anything close to it. First of all i have watched many TV shows, both that now i consider good and bad, and when i say a lot i mean it (The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Arrow, Sherlock, House Of Cards, True Detective...). Now i stopped doing that, because i realized i was wasting a lot of time watching TV shows. The only TV shows that i now watch are Game Of Thrones and House Of Cards. I would say i have grown up a bit in 3 years, but i only see those TV shows worth spending my time on. Now that i have told you my backstory i can start praising Game Of Thrones, and saying how everything is perfect, except i WILL NOT do that. I will tell you what i think makes this show that good and why you should start watching it, but i will also focus a bit on the bad sides that there aren't many, but they have to be brought up in order for you to make a good judgement about it. If you are expecting a TV show just to spend your Friday or Monday night, entertaining yourself at the moment you won't get that with Game Of Thrones. What you will get instead ""Game Of Thrones"" is a big journey, full of carefully invented events and characters. The characters are psychologically well described, exactly like people in real life. Each one of the characters has his goals, motivations, morals and specific mindset (way of thinking) that the show presents it to you in the best way possible. If you wan't to understand it better, you should read something on reddit or rewatch the show, because a lot more is going on than what you have noticed. It's made in a way that if you think and analyze the decisions of the characters you will end up predicting how they will act in the future, like a game of chess. It has a lot of plot twists that you will never expect and that will definitely shock you while watching it. The most important thing that makes me love this show so much is how realistic it actually is. But wait you will ask yourself this is a fantasy show isn't it? Yes it is, because there is a world just for ""Game of Thrones"" , with specific history, geography, politics, holidays, and even the accents of characters who are from different places in Westeros are specific. It has even two languages made just for the show with around 1000-3000 words. You can see the realism in the show, just from it's motto that it is ""All men must die"", meaning that everything can happen in the show just like in real life. There is not a main character that beats all the odds and lives happily forever after. No every character in ""Game Of Thrones"" has it's good and bad sides, ups and downs, and most importantly everyone can die in any moment, there is not coincidences like in other movies or TV shows, where at the end the character will be saved by some miracle or a coincidence. The show doesn't have a hero, nor a villain, but it makes you decide for yourself who the hero is and who the villain is. What i think makes this show the best of them all is that it can be watched by any audience and still be enjoyed by everyone. Whether you are an intellectual and a very educated person or not very much educated (no offense to anyone), this show has something for everyone. Whether you are watching it for the dragons, the middle aged theme, the sexual scenes, or like me for the game of chess that's going on in it from the start, you fill find something that will hook you to it. I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT! What i would say that people don't like much about it, it's the start of the show. It takes some time to meet and get to know the characters, and when you start, you will not have much to go on, but when you finish the first few episodes it just won't leave your mind. I want to thank you for reading this rather big review, but i think you will find it very helpful considering my experience with TV shows. And yes, Game Of Thrones is really my number one favorite. PS. I apologize if there are a couple of grammar mistakes, that's because English in not my first language. Wish you all the best :)"
275,"I have never been more impressed,with a more gripping and unforgettable show.The characters.Plot.Action.Theme.All make me want this show to never end.You could say this show is over-perverted,and disgusting,but without that you would only have accented people having never-ending dialogues over wine.I have never seen a show with more depth and motivation in their characters.Even those who get annoying George R.R. Martin fixes somehow.Unforgettable one liners,cool action,and ever revolving plot,will keep you forever entertained.Unless you don't like extremely graphic content (the shows only fault),this show will be perfect for you!"
276,"My title says it all. Why do people compare series or movies with the books? Series or a movie can NEVER be as good as a book! I almost never read books but when you read a book you use your imagination and your imagination is ALWAYS better then seeing series. Just to say that the comparison is pure rubbish. You can compare series to series, movies to movies and books to books but not compare a series to a movie or a book to movie, etc.. Some of the critics here say that the cast is bad. I dare people to make a better cast for this show, especially Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister is superb.

I never read the books and I think Game of Thrones is awesome. Maybe it's because I never read the books, maybe it's because it's just a brilliant show. But only for the opening credits you can give this show a point or 2 extra. I say this without any doubt in my mind that that is the best opening of a show ever made.

For the people who compare this to LOTR. Yes, it's a bit of the same scenery with the knights and the fortresses but except for that they has no similarities. LOTR is mostly known for their epic battles were Game of thrones is more about honor, love, betrayal,... . And as I said movies can't be compared with series. This is a perfect example. In series it's much more about character building with lot's of characters were movies focus more on one character or like in LOTR they focus more on the mission of destroying the ring and the story around that. You can say that the ring is the main character in those movies. Game of thrones has lot's of main characters (The Lannisters, The Starks, Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, Theon Greyjoy, etc.).

What I think about this show is that it's the second best series I've ever watched (except from breaking bad). If you like a well written, well acted fantasy series with lot's of drama, action and humor you should watch this show. You WILL like it !"
277,"Not for a long time has television seen a show of such allure. Game of Thrones has taken me as well as thousands of other viewers by our ears and eyes into a new world, one that we become emotionally attached to. When starting such a series, one must be skeptical, but no fear, this is a ride you want to stay on. Perfectly cast, and entertaining and informational to even the people who have not read the novels, the creators of the show have hit this one out of the ballpark. I personally have become engrossed and am always craving more of my favorite house's adventures in Westeros.

Thank you, HBO, for taking me to a new place for an hour at a time."
278,"this is one of the if not the best show I have ever seen. it has tits, blood and dragons sadly every season is just 10 episodes. they are 1 hour long though. the visuals are amazing and the series is easily downloadable (i didn't download it of course). one advise i should give is that you should not search the web for Game of Thrones. or the comment section on YouTube. it is filled with spoilers. the series is based upon a series of books. the people that read these book are giant assholes because they will spoil every thing before it even happened in the series.

with that said. go watch the show! if you haven't yet. you do not know what you are missing out on.

~loldude12"
279,"It took a little while to figure out all the threads but this season has held every emotion. Its crazy good. The characters are rich and complex and force you to change your opinions of them over time. The writers have created a completely different world which I buy into just like any of the great science fiction entries of the past that transported me into something extraordinary. Prepare to love and hate once it sucks you in.

The female characters steal the show. My absolute favorite is the youngest Stark girl, Arya. She is fierce and driven and remarkable, surviving everything thrown at her. The female characters are so strong, in fact, that the males - who rule the world - put their lives on the line for them...happily."
280,"This show is so good, it made me watch its first two seasons for five times until now. Each time I discovered new, more subtle details, which gave the story even more meaning. I have never been so hooked up to a show.

The story is extremely captivating. There are a lot of subplots, more or less interconnected to each other, each having its own characteristic ""color"". One can tell immediately that it is based on a good book.

The characters are complex. A good versus evil split between them is hard to draw, since you can easily relate to them through different situations. This is very pleasantly surprising, given the fact that the show depicts a fantasy world, which would automatically lead to the good/evil split like in so many fantasy worlds (e.g. Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Chronicles Of Narnia...). But not this show. Here you can see a fantasy world which is closer to the real one, where people act as driven by different reasons, beliefs or desires.

The plot is often breathtaking, and the show is filled with shocking events, which make you question you expectations a lot. The drama is so good, there were a couple of big moments throughout the show where the major goosebumps I experienced were accompanied by trembling hands and wet eyes.

If you haven't watched this show yet, you don't know what you're missing!"
281,"The casting, acting, story-line, fantasy - well I could keep describing the outline of the show but there is no need for that, this is a great show, never before have I given a 10/10 but I have to admit this show deserves it, I hope it goes for further than 3-4 seasons, shows like this deserve to continue and I'm pretty sure everyone who has seen it would agree.

Season 3 is something I've been awaiting for quite a while and my expectations are to be met, I am pretty sure of that, as so far game of thrones hasn't let me down, season 1-2 were amazing, specially how they twist the story and play with the cast, overall amazing. -latinohabanero :)"
282,"I just was a little bit doubtful when i saw that this was fantasy. First episode and i was completely hooked. There is just so awesome casting and the script is pure titanium. I just cant wait till my next watching happens. I recommend this show to every one who watches series that has clever story, awesome casting and brilliant directing. And let my remind that this series is suited to everyone who enjoys pure hardcore acting. I actually live in Scandinavia and I pay for watching this movie. What more can i say watch this series, because it has very good point concerning life. It has very good meaning and i watch every episode all over again. Nice job. Ps. if you have extra money invest it in Scandinavia to this series, I promise you wont regret it."
283,"We should all be thankful that SyFy did not attempt this. From the start this was always going to be a very difficult series to move from page to whatever it is that they record films on these days! Having watched the first two episodes, it is loyal to the book, no doubt due to George RR Martin acting as a consultant. It will be pacey because the books are so vivid and descriptive. Those that have not read the books may well wonder what is going on and actually be inspired to read them. A very gritty HBO drama with the usual gratuitous nudity, but hey! Thats what we wanted isn't it? The casting of Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister is inspired and he plays the part brilliantly. Thoroughly enjoyable and I look forward to the next episode."
284,"Where do i start first of all this show is HOR-RIBLE like a car wreck where a family of four gets mangled and killed horrible. I'm not trying to be mean i'm just going based off my observations.I will break this down as simple as possible.

Acting : Not good,if i were to rate the acting on a IQ scale i'd put it at 50.Which translates to being mentally retarded, the writing is some what to blame but.If these actors had any really good talent that was above average.They could make the show much better even with sh*&^% dialogue.Why any self respecting actor would chose to be on this show,is a sign that there is no good actors here at all.At least any with good judgement or integrity.Any actor with real talent would only be undermining themselves by doing this garbage.

Plot: Dungeons and dragons with lots of violence and lots of sex.Just think of eating something thats way overcooked and.You're pretty much getting the same thing here.Luckily this show has a built in audience or else it would of sank along time ago.The main ingrediant for this show has become just to shock and confuse people.To keep them interested which is usually a sign that the creators are struggling to keep this show afloat.Even going as far as throwing in the sex sounds when peter dinklage is getting his knob slobbed.It's like they had prepubescent boys in the editing room;working the sound effects.

Writing:I doubt there is any writers ,if i had to guess i would say they are just pulling dialogue right from the book verbatim.

Overall the show is held together by gum and paper clips ,theres only so many times graphic violence and sex will work .There was a scene where one of the male characters is giving a monologue with two female actresses.Performing sex acts on each other while trying to sound serious i felt embarrassed for the actor and actresses that had to put up with that.This show has absolutely NO substance what so ever the best advice i can give is this .If you want to know what this show is really like don't go to someone who is a fanboy of it .They will just sensationalize it for you.Which will just winde up misleading you to wasting your time watching this junk.This show trys

way to hard and doesn't deserve any of credit for its efforts. I wish IMDb allowed for negative numbered ratings so i could give this a proper rating.EPIC FAIL"
285,"My husband read the book to this. He loves historical fiction, so as a gift I thought I would buy him the box set. I loved it, couldn't wait to watch it every evening until I found it getting more and more graphic with, from what I can see, no real artistic reason other than to lure in another category of viewers that may otherwise be less sated by the actual quality of the content, story and acting. The scene between the prostitutes was, what can only be categorised as, soft porn. It was gratuitous and made me feel uncomfortable as it was relentless - we get the point Mr Director, you don't need to ram it down our throats. I have 2 or 3 episodes left to watch, but am now left less enthused about getting through them. Disappointing."
286,"I knew nothing about this series, neither literature nor this screen adaptation, nor even the author's work and name. This discovery was perfectly casual if it wasn't by my sceptical analysis of recent Conan's adaptation. We discussed John Millus' Conan, Robert E. Howard's and ""Savage Sword of Conan"", summoning the souls that should be transposed to the big screen.

It was mentioned the plastic and orgasmic status Hollywood had presently acquired from the past few decades since its lack of profoundness, lack of critical approach, exuberance of ephemeral sensational effects and deeply poor acting had become its rooted motto of making money by exclusive brief debuts and marketing. The audience is attracted to a blockbuster movie like a donkey is to a carrot, exactly what I was expecting and confirmed later to be the new ""Conan"". Someone suggested This series in contrast to the cheesy updated blockbuster.

This introduction reminds me that I found everything I was searching for not in the new ""Conan"" adaptation but here, in ""Game of Thrones"" - the art of narrative, the real acting and the incredible immersion in a fictionalized world where ancient archetypes and human spirit, plots, dilemmas, are all present. For my surprise I had my fingers fondling my beard, synonymous of intensely tasting what I was seeing while following the pilot episode, cursing slang with excellency attributions.

Tolkien was always a reference since I remember, directly or unconsciously in my fictional world and I always felt that good adaptations of big tomes couldn't arise from spectacular blockbusters nor compressed movies - its juice would be simply wasted. Lord of the Rings was average but it wouldn't be that juicy if some few excellent actors and some very good special effects weren't present.

But what can I say more? Shakespeare, Tolkien, literature, very wise application of special effects, excellent plot and acting, bold posture of using nudity naturally, bold posture of having a ""dwarf"" as main character (my favorite by the way) breaking bounds of politically correct, excellent costumes and characterization, what can I say more? I found everything here and like a kid I'm anxious to see the next episode (updated:season) already attached to the characters and this complex unpredictable and political world.

Congratulations to George R. R. Martin the composer, to David Benioff and D.B. Weiss the marvelous interpreters and congratulations to the Bold HBO that allowed it to be materialized as also as to every mastered craftsman making it possible."
287,"As far as entertainment goes, this is a must watch. Book-and TV-series both. If you are browsing these parts of the woods (imdb, and forum) you cannot do yourself justice by passing up A Song of Fire and Ice: Game of Thrones.

It has everything any average viewer might enjoy; great Irish scenery, a marvelous cast, each and every acting contribution flawlessly incorporated into this vast, epic saga of perfected genuine storytelling. Modern/urban fantasy story at it's grandest, incredibly visceral and layered characters, the effects are top-notch, some small essence of mystical, fantastical magic in the background, beautiful script mostly staying true to it's father, A Song of Ice and Fire by R.R. Martin.

And the great effort done on the details, making the lands of Vesteros, mind-numbingly real.

10/10

As good as it gets."
288,"Game of thrones.. it is coming to an end next year, I hope. Please no spinoffs or any other BS. Just end it. End it right. Have the freaking Whitewalkers win just so Hollywood doesn't try any BS. RR, you made more than enough money. Just end this so you can get back to not writing your books on time. But mainly end this so it stops going downhill. The past few seasons have been so by the Hollywood blueprint that it is disappointing. If there were another 3 seasons left of this show I would have stopped watching back in 2016. Whatever, at least the series started out well enough. I would rank it a 7/10 but people are overrating it so a 2/10 it is."
289,"Everyone is so dull and I can't tell who is who. At least have some easier names for people to understand them. I call everyone person 1 and bearded man. At least have people understand what is happening. This show is just so stubborn. After 3 episodes, I was done and decided to spend my time better watching anything else that this garbage. The writer of this show should just stop trying to make people like these characters and stop trying to make these people cool. Game of thrones is just messed up, George Martin is OK and should spend his time better and could do better. You kill 1 of the most popular actors in the show and make people hate the prince geek. I think this show is just a waste of time to all the viewers and of they like it, OK for them. They can sit through garbage writing and acting and I salute you all."
290,"First let me just say that this show is probably a 4 or 5, but since the overall score is 9.5, I felt compelled to counteract it; thus the rating of only 1 star.

First off, let me begin with the positives, which, believe me, won't take long. The acting is pretty good, and the special effects are decent. That's pretty much it when it comes to positives.

Now for what justifies the single star. Simply put, the show has virtually no plot. It's basically a bunch of houses vying to become king, because the old king was overthrown, which by the time of the second season, we have all but forgotten why. This hardly counts as a plot. There is no climax, there is no hook, it's basically a documentary of a fictional land.

Now onto the characters. There a million houses, all interchangeable, with house mottos probably generated off of a website. You could not mention a single house for the entire season and nobody would even notice! Characters are killed off (unnecessarily gory) for fun. This is not so much a problem as there are way too many characters to begin with. However, you immediately realize there is a problem when none of the deaths cause you to feel any emotion. This is because none of the characters are developed, and the ones that are aren't likeable at all.

To top this off, there is constant violence, sex, rape, and nudity. If I wanted porn, I would have just searched up videos on the internet! There are a lot of people on here who justify this by saying that this is somehow historically accurate and displays the plight of the people in the middle ages. If you wanted to watch that, why don't you watch a documentary???

To summarize, there is plot, no likeable characters, and way too much unnecessary content. I'd rather watch paint dry than this crap."
291,"My advice: first read the books and we'll see if you give it more than 4 stars. I don't think so... This is one of the best fantasy saga I've ever read. Can't say that about series - sorry. It's shallow and boring with no attention to the details, plain and simple. Nudity & gore is not enough to keep mature audience entertained. It's good for teenagers though. If you're true fan of the books - stay out of it! If you haven't read the books yet - do it now and learn the difference. I truly wanted this to be a great series, but it's not. Period. Saying it's true masterpiece and the best series of all times is just ludicrous and immature, unless you have no expectations at all."
292,Seasons 1-4 provide some of the best storytelling and entertainment to ever grace a screen. After that point it mostly goes to shit in every aspect with maybe one or two exception.
293,"A little about the show: the show takes place in an alternate world that is so meticulously set out that one would think that it's real. Each house's history is so complex, the characters so realistically dimensional that I'm not sure I was watching a documentary or a fictional show. This, however, is not a series about fighting and bloodshed. This show is all politics and relationships between people, classes, and races. So now, after watching six season of this show, I am a total Song of Fire and Ice junkie and I have gotten my whole family hooked on this show as well. Do I recommend this TV show? Well, only if you are not scared of being blinded at the brilliance of this show. However, ""Game of Thrones"" totally blew me away. Even for HBO's standards, this show is just epic. I rate this show an firm 10/10."
294,"I had to come and write a review even though I rarely do, so why am I writing one now? Because of the trolls that just love to hate on anything and try to drag down the score of what is easily a 10 star rated show. There is no reason this show should be scored anything below a 10. It has everything and is so appealing visually the only score for it is a 10, acting 10, story line 10, special effects 10 and so on. The only complaint I have is George wanted 13 episode seasons and D&D would only do 10, that is truly sad, D&D have shorted us important story lines that have been cut for time and so they have cheated us out of 18 eps at and hour each, that's 180 hours of GoT left on the table, that's a travesty.So for you trolls that want to hate something so glorious, hate away, you are insignificant and enjoy your miserable existences while I and millions of others enjoy the Game of Thrones :)"
295,"If you're looking for your usual, cliché, implicit epic-fantasy story, then this is not it.

Everything is just raw and brutal, serving more than what you've asked for but certainly exceeding your expectations for the better. I may have read the books, but the spin of the characters in the series highlights the supporting ones and adds their weights and purpose for the story. Jaw-dropping, if one might say. The cuts of the scenes are also terrific, making viewers want more.

Possibly the best TV-show as of today. Game of Thrones certainly made its own name under the epic-fiction genre, even creating its own original division."
296,"Fantasy has, for many years, been regarded as a genre for mostly children. A few notable exceptions being The Lord Of The Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien , His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman and Wheel Of Time by Robert Jordan , have defied this bias by providing imaginative and emotionally as well as intellectually resonant stories that stand among the best in English Literature.

Genre Television too, has suffered from a similar bias,turning off many viewers who have little love for complex fantasy story lines and many long,confusing names. Elements such as magic or fantasy creatures have been dismissed as ""childish"" and 'simplistic"".

These two would, in theory, produce a poor mix.

Game Of Thrones defies these notions even more resoundly than any work of epic fantasy before it. A staggering show full of lavish production values, dazzling visual sound effects, and above all, a raft of extremely memorable characters with their own story lines and ideals.

Based on George R. R. Martin's ""A Song Of Ice And Fire"" novels, the main story focuses on 3 major story lines: The eternal conflict and power struggle between the Great Houses of Westeroes known as the titular ""Game Of Thrones"", The Oncoming threat of Winter and the mysterious ancient creatures it brings and the chronicle of a young girl named Danaerys Targaryen, last of an ancient family, and her return to Westeros to exact revenge for the death of her family and downfall of her house.

Here we see that medieval politics,dark fantasy and classic drama are intertwined to produce a rare cross-genre hybrid. Genre blending in general is risky as it can tend to produce shows that lack proper identity and purpose. Game Of Thrones avoids these pitfalls by toning down some of the pure fantasy elements (magic, mythical creatures)and focuses more on it's political subplots and character drama, resulting in a show that appeals to both hardcore fantasy fans as well as most non-genre viewers.

The writing is magnificent across the board. Martin himself heavily influences the production of the show, in both managing story lines as well as the writing of the characters. Much credit must be given to D.B. Weiss and David Benioff, showrunners on GoT, for extracting the best dialogue from the books for the characters to work with. Given that at the time of writing of this review , the show has indeed surpassed the books' storyline, how the showrunners can continue to produce high quality drama without the great authors prose behind them remains to be seen.

The Acting is among the best in TV. The anchor of it all is Peter Dinklage's powerhouse performance as Tyrion Lannister, a character often described as the main reason for the show's continuing success. Dinklage brings weight, dimension and humanity to a complex, riveting character that would have otherwise been wasted on any other actor. Lena Headey continues to shine as Cersei, along with Emillia Clarke, Maisie Williams, Aidan Gillen and a host of other actors turning in great performances.

Warning to those who have yet to see the show: The show is dark in many ways more than one. The World of Westeros is a parallel of the real world during the dark ages, filled with corruption, cruelty and vice. Nudity, language and violence are core elements of the shown, seen in every episode. While little to none of it is tasteless, a strong stomach and a very open mind is required to truly appreciate Game Of Thrones. The graphic and disturbing nature of the show has overwhelmed many in the past and will continue to do so. Traumatic is often used to describe Game Of Thrones, as many characters the audience comes to identify with can be and often are, brutally and unexpectedly murdered. The show can be harsh and unforgiving, a mirror of the world it portrays.

Game Of Thrones is dark. It is brutal. It asks sophisticated questions and denies us easy answers. And it is also beautiful, witty, complex and breathtaking. Whatever your views on fantasy or dark drama or TV in general, it is a show that demands to be experienced.

It has heralded a new age of Fantasy Television. We may never see the likes of it again."
297,"This TV show is like an artist drawing on his canvas, With every stroke a picture starts to emerge, And once you see a glimpse of what the whole picture looks like, It will be impossible to turn away.

GoT is one of the, If not, The best TV show ever made, And it's all thanks to George RR Martin, The author of the books. I have to warn you, If you intend on watching this show, Then you are in for so many twists that it will make your head spin, Towards the end of the first season you will get a peek into the dark and brilliant mind of GRRM. This is a show that isn't afraid to take a step over the edge and drop you into a never ending free fall into an abyss and you will love every second of it."
298,"Game of Thrones may be the best book-to-movie(/TV show) adaptation I have ever seen and is also the best fantasy I had the chance to enjoy. Not being able to calm myself until season 3 came up, I started reading the books (at the moment I'm at ""A dance with dragons which is the latest volume in this series of so far) and can't say how happy I am to see that the TV adaptation stays very close to its roots - not only because the author of the books also helps writing the scripts for the episodes. Of course there are many events which had need to be cut or even left out but as a reader of the books I assure anyone that watching the series does not leave you with mere impression of what is delivered on written paper. ""A game of thrones"" aka ""A song of ice and fire"" is: clever in its narrative; entertaining and really complex but therefor way more satisfying than anything I ever watched; brings up political and even ethical questions in a way which doesn't make them look cheap;.... just puts a shame on every single badly-delivered fantasy series out there ...

If you haven't watched it yet - even if you're not in fantasy or knights and swords - you may want to give this series a try."
299,"I am an addict. I love movies as I love TV series, drama, comedy, war  all genres. As long as a production has something to give, to pass to its audience, I watch it.

I'll start by saying that Lord of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movie series ever made. It made me drift into this fantasy world, full of magic and beauty complemented by blood and hate. Game of Thrones is the single TV series that has brought me close to that feeling of warmth and for that, THANK YOU!

It tells a story on many planes that always intercept at some point, it links the power of name and blood to the will of the people, it gives meaning to the word 'honor' and it surely makes you step into another dimension, that of kings and magic. I'm not talking about real magic, or not the 'Harry Potter' type at least, but about the magic of life, love and power. You barely can handle the week between the episodes, keen to see what comes next, what will that lord do and how will that prisoner escape, keeps you on your toes. It gives you the feeling of 'everlasting', wishing that it will actually last forever because: IT'S THAT GOOD!

I will end by saying that this series is unique compared to all TV series I've seen, better than Rome, Spartacus, The Tudors, etc It's the closest you can get to the 'nobleness' it stands for so proudly."
300,"This series has got to be by far the best I've seen to-date. The authenticity of characters and places was stunning. I wasn't expecting much when it first aired, but then I was hooked. 2012 is too long to wait for the next season! Brilliant cast, excellent acting, great direction. Loved Sean Bean in the role of Ned Stark as the King's Hand. Lena Headey has come a long way from the ""Sarah Connor Chronicles""! Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister was outstanding and immensely enjoyable to watch. The integrity of every cast member's role was maintained to the finish of the season. Can't wait to see what happens next. Have half a mind to get and read the entire series of A Song of Ice and Fire."
301,"There is no caress, no foreplay, they get naked right away, the female lies back passively, the male penetrates and that's it. People watch this and think this is good sex? This might work in pornography, but this is the reason why divorce is rampant: women get tired of this bull where their chances of being fulfilled are next to null.

These sex scenes show folks to get naked right away and spread your legs, to roll on top of her then roll off. It is absurd and makes me hate these shows for propagating such false ideas. The true idea is that most women are too modest to rip off their clothes, ant that's not the most erotic way to interact anyway. The real news is that women need caressing and foreplay. The sex scenes in these shows (like say ""Spartacus"") are sexist propaganda, and as a woman watching, it really makes me mad."
302,This is definitely a bull's eye. We will not see perfection like this for another 50 years. Mark my words.
303,As of 2019 this is the best tv show humanity has created. Seriously.
304,Cinematography of the show is perfect. Perfect show to watch...
305,Greatest TV show EVER! You never know what is going to happen next. Watch four episodes if you are not hooked then stop watching.
306,Fantastic tv show it's incredible and amazing waiting for season 8.
307,"Game of Thrones is a beautiful adaption of its famous books. Drama at every corner, action at the blink of an eye, this TV show sets the standard for any genre of TV to a new High. The Performances are amazing, the special effects are stunning, and the plot has so many twists and turns you'll be begging for more and more. I started watching this show just to see what all the hype was about and boy did it exceed my expectations. I finished all the seasons in a matter of weeks (I had a lot of free time on my hands). While its a long show (each episode is about an hour or more long) it is well worth the watch and it can turn even the sportiest bro into a warlock-loving nerd."
308,"1st to 6th seasons have normal speed. But starting from 7th, everything is moving very quickly, because the show writers and staff don't care about us, viewers any more. They care for many reasons only about one thing - to finish the show as quickly as possible."
309,"Take away the huge amount of money that went into making the last season and there is nothing left. Seasons 1-6 had depth, character studies, great dialogues and a world that was alive. Season 7 has expensive spectacle that is losely tied together by some quickly hashed plot. Also, what happened in costume design? It seems everyone is wearing super hero costumes in S7. With the black, tightly fitting costumes everyone is wearing now for weeks at a time. In the earlier seasons the characters wore realistic looking armour, different gowns and doublets"
310,"Godly, it gets better and better each season . Season 7 finale got me in awe . I can't wait for the last season in the late 2018. Everything from plot , cast , effects and music is astounding . I hope the last 6 episodes of the show will be long enough like mini-movies or something like that . I expect nothing less of a masterpiece we saw in the earlier seasons."
311,"This series is the dream to come true. A show that truly sets the novel on TV and slowly moves the story forward using incredibly well written dialogues, supported with a outstanding music and places.

On spot cast assures that the characters are likable and understandable in their situations, and the villains will truly make you hate them - and love them as actors for that.

Watching this will leave you interested in the world, characters, background stories. It will leave you happy, but also sad and mad. Your loved characters will probably die. For a good reason, or for no reason at all. It's just cruel as that. But most importantly, Game of Thrones will always leave you thrilled for more episodes."
312,"I never, ever write reviews, but GoT has definitely earned it. Bold, shocking storytelling at it's finest. It's really no wonder why GoT is hailed as the most popular, most awarded and most critically acclaimed show ever. If you're not a fan of the fantasy genre, you might dismiss Thrones as Hobbit hype or '' fantasy crap' but you'd be wrong. It's in the HBO tradition of The Wire, The Sopranos, Deadwood and Westworld, a big-budget tour of a fictional world with its own moral rules, where rival families battle for control and power. The political intrigue, mysteries and suspense will suck you in, even if you know nothing about politics. Every aspect of GoT is near pefection, from the story, to the actors, to the characters, to character development, acting, plots, plot-twists, red-herrings, locations, costumes, sets, action sequences, battles, visuals, cgi, soundtracks, buildup, script, dialogue, everything is extremely detailed and polished. Adapted from George.RR.Martin's literary monstrosity, published in 1996, HBO's adaptation has stayed true to the story's roots (even if it has taken some major liberties). It addresses thousands of different themes ranging from the loss of innocence, to war, peace, love, hate, sex, sexuality, philosophy, vengeance, religion, culture, art, music, politics, economics, metaphysics, anthropology, justice, law, morality, spirituality, intolerance, prejudice, civilization, poetry, chaos, global warming, nihilism, pantheism, the destruction of nature, loss of humanity, childhood, adventure, magic, fear, illusions, manipulation, power, death, life, grief, violence, rape, incest, beauty and so.. GoT is filled with magic and the occult but always in a realistic and ominous way, never too widespread or too obvious giving it a sense of realism and mystery that other fantasy stories never have. GoT is also well known for it's shock factor and brutal unpredictability. Always expect the unexpected when watching GoT and try not to get too attached to characters as none are safe (ever). That being said, GoT is without a doubt one of the greatest shows in the history of television. An instant cult masterpiece and a perfect example of unity in form and function. A MUST watch for everyone above 18."
313,"I bought and read Game of Thrones the year it came out. I was hooked, bought and read each book the week it came out. Book 4 left us wondering what was going on, where we were going, but book 5 put us right back on track.

Martin is an extraordinary writer, with extraordinary vision. But as a lover of the book series, i cannot love the HBO series.

As a stand alone series its second to none, with incredible characters, story and acting, but it has begun to stray so far from the books now, it has destroyed the books.

The first series stayed very true, as did the second, but after that it strayed, and the latest series, well, i could not finish watching it.

I would not recommend reading the books if you watched the series, or watch the series if you read the books.

Now i understand that most books do not convert directly to the screen. LoTR was a classic example of this, and Peter Jackson (barring a couple of epic failures) did an incredible job (though he murdered the hobbit). But Game of Thrones you could have converted 99% to screen and not deviate almost at all.

Sadly i wish i had not watched the series now, as i feel i will not enjoy book six as much (if it ever arrives)."
314,"The best thing about this show is how close it brings fantasy to reality, keeping in touch with the imagination and exhilaration of Dragons. The thing I personally hate about Movies or shows that are based on novels or books is how much they leave behind, but GOT not only appreciate George's (Author of The Song of Ice and Fire; The books the show is based on) work but takes it a step further by adding a sense of surprise even for the book lovers.There are plot twists and treachery at every corner, and this is not your every day show where the protagonist gets away with almost anything.

The show is the best ensemble of politics, war, fantasy and every thing else (including Dragons, you just cant get enough of them). The cast and creators have done a fantastic job.

The cast is the best set of actors that make you love or hate the character in an instant. You will see dwarfs in a completely different light after this show. And you just cant hate Joffrey and Cersi enough.

And if all the above doesn't get you hooked to the show ... there are boobies and a lot of them."
315,"This series is definitely a fantasy piece. The locales are outstanding, there are knightly games and battles, and the costumes are what you'd expect for a Dark Ages period story.

But don't let any of that lull you into a sense that you'll be seeing a ""Lord of the Rings"" copy cat. Game of Thrones is a political intrigue story about several Houses (clans, family groups) and their struggle for dominance. The story is very engaging and quite well scripted. It is very easy to imagine something like this had actually happened in history.

The acting is standard for the genre. Expect to hear generic English accents from most of the cast, although the story specific language is spoken very well. It sounds like a mix of Elvish and Arabic; the actors must have practiced it a lot. There are a few moments where the acting is stiff or forced but all in all it's good.

It should be noted that this is an HBO original series, and like other series from HBO and Showtime you can expect the cookie-cutter formula for ""risky and shocking"". What it amounts to is an abundance of nudity (male and female) and strong language (F-bombs) that isn't actually necessary. In several places it actually slows the progression as the episode stops for a moment to allow naked people to randomly pop into the scene. If full frontal nudity is a major turn off for you then you will not enjoy the series as it pervades every episode.

The only complaint I have is that it seems like something has been left out, most likely for timing. There are a few minor arcs that are introduced and then disappear for quite a while, only to jump back in at an odd time. For example: in the first episode there is a lot of emphasis put on the dire wolves. They get a bit of screen time in the first two episodes then disappear except for parts where it's necessary to move the story forward. I know I'm supposed to care about the critters as much as the characters (apparently) do, but they don't get enough screen time to be more than furry props.

Still, this is a very good series. I'd recommend it to anyone who can stomach HBO shows."
316,"I had heard how amazing the books were, but never red them. When i found out that Game of Thrones came out as a TV series, i was really curious to start watching it. After having seen 3 episodes, i can say that it is really interesting, and probably one of the best TV series i have seen lately. I hope to keep this opinion for the episodes coming , but till now it is way better than my expectations.

The scenarios is stunning, and most of the actors really good. Perhaps the only disadvantage i noticed is that some scenes are dark, and you can not make out clearly what is going on.

This series is not suitable for ages lower than 13, but is a must (till now) for older people that love epic movies."
317,"I might very well be late to the party, but I couldn't go without reviewing this series.

It actually scares and sickens me that 'Game of Thrones' has been receiving such high praise all throughout - I honestly couldn't find anything redeemable about it, but I still gave it two stars out of ten in case I'm forgetting something (hardly, though).

Since it is based on a book, some of my points may also apply to G.R.R. Martin's ''work'', who looks as much a psycho as the directors of this atrocious show.

'Game of Thrones' is the most wicked television series (include movies) I have ever seen, a madman's hymn about their own deranged fantasies. From the very first episode you get the feeling that something is wrong: that violence and senseless gore are the norm, that limbs and heads are being chopped just because, to trigger the inner sociopath in the audience. I have no doubt whatsoever that the creators of this show get aroused at the sight of spilled guts and the slit throat of a newborn.

'Game of Thrones is nothing it pretends to be. It tries to be political and full of intrigue, when it is not. The half-arsed politics are just a means for another death or sex scene, which is all this series is about. The world's most expensive snuff film.

One (automatic) excuse you'll hear from the fans, should you negatively critique their beloved masterpiece, is that it is a realistic portrait of Medieval times, when very clearly it is not (for anybody with the minimal grasp of European history), and, in fact, just another disgustingly sold lie to keep this show's easily gullible audience glued to the screen, drooling at the rape of yet another royal vulva.

Keep your children away from this. Worringly, many are watching this vile, depraved and repulsive soft porno right now. 'Game of Thrones' is a blatant insult to human intelligence and decency. Shame on everyone involved in it."
318,"I know I am going to sound like a total fanboy, but what a spectacular job they have done with game of thrones!! The casting is like plucking the imagery, that author Martin has so richly set, straight from my brain. Normally, with any book adaptations, the expectation of the characters and their core traits, both physically and emotionally, is a rare probability. HBO has absolutely nailed it. The acting is top notch, the set design pinnacle (pause your dvr sometime and notice the intricacies of the various elements within each set), and the script does exquisite justice to Martin's imagery. I can only anticipate the growing intricacies of the plot lines to come, and cannot wait to see each character develop as the story unfolds. I have thought for several years that no show could give me the rush of emotion and anxiety as I experienced watching ""Band of Brothers"", HBO has trumped themselves, and I believe have created the greatest production of a show ever to graced television. I also give the earliest possible prediction that Peter Dinklage will get nominated for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for either best actor or best supporting, and he should win one if not both. I urge anyone who has not done so to watch this series, and enjoy getting lost in a tapestry of richly woven threads."
319,"Whilst the story line induces compulsive viewing, the content and pitch leave much to be desired. What with women being treated like pieces of meat with no value other than breeding or pleasure; babies being slaughtered and fed to monsters, murdering and burning young children; dismembering people on all scales including genitally; stabbing pregnant women; incest between fathers and daughters and brothers and sisters; dirty old men bedding girls young enough to be their grandchildren; sadism, torture, murder, cruelty with a marked lack of compassion, mercy or any other redeeming factors, it's a wonder that this show is so popular. So it must be assumed that people are just addicted to pain, suffering and violence.

The problem with shows like this is that they set a terrible example that downloads into viewers subconscious minds and is then digested on a deep level only to pop out of someone later in 'real life' It has been known to happen. Sp, whilst the production is lavish, there are no positive features in terms of message; few heroic acts that often end with the heroes being murdered and the only motivation of the characters is lust, greed and power. TV is dangerously influential and should be handled with care. THIS is a celebration of everything abhorrent about the human condition and is being used as entertainment.

Whilst LOTR demonstrated elegance, beauty, magic, love and heroism as well as flawless production and direction, this is junk food made with the specific purpose of lowering your vibration and has come from from the gutters of deeply disturbed minds who are now in control of the industry. There is no doubt an addictive quality to it but it's far too repellent to be tolerated on a long term basis. After a while the violence gets repulsive because it does not offer anything good, uplifting or positive. It's actually disturbing that it is so popular. I wouldn't be surprised if there were subliminal messages worked in to get people hooked. Either that or human thirst for pain has sadly become the norm. But then, that's what brainwashing is all about!"
320,"First thing, I am a HUGE fan of George R.R. Martin books, specially the Songs of Ice and Fire novels.

I was so happy when I heard that this novels will be filmed and released as a show. Enormous plus was the fact that it will be filmed in HBO production, which is in my opinion, the absolute leader in the field of filming shows and series.

Last week I saw first 14 minutes of the show on official HBO website, and.... shivers went up and down my spine of shear excitement!

Finally the day to see the first episode was here. And here were the expectations, so much of them. And that probably is the thing that almost ruined everything for me... First 14 minutes that I saw earlier were so tense, realistic and even scary! Everything was as I imagined while reading the book! Characters were on a highest level, setting was awesome, the winter was coming! I was thrilled! And expectations increased accordingly... After that moment something happened and my overall experience with the episode went down the hill. I found some of the acting a bit weird, music didn't fit all of the time and sometimes annoyed me. Interiors were too artificial and, again, didn't fit my expectations. Everything happened too fast, which is logical since the information in the book are massive and it would be hard to fit them all into the series, but I could notice that, and that is more than enough to give me the reason to think is it possible that one of largest and most beautiful fantasy books ever are too complicated and complex to film a series about them.

After the first episode I can only say: Peter Dinkleage and Sean Bean are awesome as usual! The episode followed the book in best possible manner (even though too fast), characters and locations are just as you could imagine them while reading the book. The plot is is intriguing and will pin down to the chair everyone that haven't read the book. Of course, there is plenty of sex, violence and blood for everyone that expect that from HBO.

Even though I think that there are flaws, The Game of Thrones episode 1 deserves enough of viewers attention to watch it once again before the second episode, just to give it a shot and I think it will repay you for that in later episodes.

All in all even though my first experience isn't the best one, I think this one is a winner which will be a must for every fan of the book, and one of best series in some time in eyes of most of the viewers that didn't read the book. Another HBO's success! Enjoy the winter!"
321,"Nice set designs, but boy oh boy... Terrible cast except 2-3 actors, slow development of the plots which are ultra diluted and have very late resolutions, not to mention the dose of pornography and incest which could have been suggested not shown in excess. The explicit content

diminish the fantasy effect of the stories. Winter is coming for 4 seasons, I was hoping Sean Bean will be alive when winter was coming. By the look of it all the main characters will die before winter. We get it the evil characters live longer than the good ones, but they tend to stop in their character development becoming predictable. Like bad acting was not enough there are hundreds of unnecessary monologues and tiny intrigues to ''feast'' your ears. Apparently 6 millions per episode can't change that and for some it's money well spent. Here is a suggestion: Put the money into more Dragon's scenes and more North of the wall scenes."
322,"This show is completely overrated. First season was decent, but seems too drawn out. Beheading here, battle scene, several episodes in between. I hope it gets better, after all the hype it receives, it certainly doesn't live up to it"
323,"Banal, puerile, putrid rubbish entirely bereft of art or merit filled to vomit point with the sickening ugly machinations of a diseased mind. How the participants who found themselves involved in this gross festering blight will face their folly in their old age hell only knows. The script and the acting is a excruciating embarrassment to behold.

It is a disgrace to the film industry if that is where it claims its origins.

It deserves to do more than just flop it should sink without trace in the deepest darkest cesspool imaginable never to see the light of day again, but no cesspool owner with a trace of self respect would admit such a vile despicable creation. A monkey with a lobotomy could have come up with a better screenplay. My colleagues consider my comments to be a tad mild."
324,"The question is not why we would watch such shows as why they would make them. They may simply want to test the limits of the art of film/show making. Perhaps they foster serious discussions of difficult subject. In my opinion, they are simply not worth the price of the film stock they are printed on. Arty crap is still crap. Don't waste your time on this. This is the kind of sick, nausea--inducing garbage that the said crowd, especially Westerners. This was probably the worst piece of cinema I've encountered, considering its very thin and simplistic plot, shadowing the disturbing atmosphere of very sinister subjects which were specifically, incest, rape and murder. The people who made the show and watch the show are just sadly very sick humans. Pure filth!!! 0/10"
325,"After feeling like I have been missing out I endured 2 seasons of this utter s##t, save yourself this loss of wasted life hours and avoid like the f#####g plague or oh my god get a life."
326,"I would have given this a 0 start, but i was not allowed as it was not an option. the acting was so bad, i wanted to die, like man it was bad, Dumb and Dumber 2 was better than this. i do not get it at all. what is is. who are the people i see on the screen. like is it real life or not. i would like to say i think the show should banned from TV. SKY and HBO should think about showing more good shows, like CW The Flash. Now thats a show i like, its realistic and link with how i feel about the world. i don't want to see people playing games to win a thrones, what kinda game show is that. this is the worst game show i have ever seen. Grant Gustin should never see this show in case he thinks its good and plays the flash in a way he might in this show. so lets save us all a problem and not watch this mess."
327,"I have spent the last 3-4 weeks, watching GOT when I can. I work full time, so as you can imagine, I don't get much time to myself. I spent years, I mean years, hearing about this series. I was always skeptical, but I thought I would give it a go. I was enjoying the story line, until I reached a certain point of no return. Things took a turn, maybe to excite the audience and make them want to watch more? I have no idea. Acting got bad, plot got messy and frustrating to watch. It was sad to watch Ned and Cat Stark disconnect from their children. Also, when Ned was locked up, where the hell was Cat? Some people might say that I don't have a life, if I'm looking for a new tv show to watch. I do have all time favourites, which are that, my favs that I literally never get tired of. So I'm not just a person who doesn't like anything. But I was willing to give this a try. I didn't even reach to the end of season 1. Long story short, I believe that life is that, short. No body has time to waste on bad tv. This show is so overrated."
328,"What happened to the writers on season 7!!?? The show went from being one of the greatest to one of the worst in one season. We were used to a story that was coherent, and credible (as science fiction can be). That is, the fantasy world had rules and the story followed such rules (like there is no time travel nor teleportation). Dialogues were coherent and smart, full of meaning and intention, and characters had well rounded personalities and were credible as flawed human beings. All that is gone in season 7. Nothing makes sense. Decisions are totally out of character, the storyline is full of flaws and inconsistencies, the dialogues are dumb and boring. I wanted to give some examples, but I am afraid that I would just describe all the episodes one by one. They are all terrible! It is a shame. HBO writers have really proved that they are NOTHING without the books. Seriously, have some dignity and quit your job. You've ruined one of the greatest TV series. Shame! Shame! Shame!"
329,"It's a Nice Show, It has it's own taste, but when people say that it is the best show in the history of television, I feel to punch them on their face. It is a Good Show, Even Amazing, But Sorry it is not near and never come close to Breaking Bad.

If you are a Fan of GOT, then Start Watching Breaking Bad, until the Last Episode of Breaking Bad, you will never Watch GOT."
330,"Game of Thrones dodges the title of just another sword and sorcery franchise.It does so primarily by refusing to believe in heroes. There are no characters who are beyond harm or human failings. Everyone in this series has their strengths and weaknesses.

Its this sense of reality that balances and makes plausible the otherworldly aspects of the series, such as magic and dragons. The acting is in many cases excellent too, with a strong cast who know their craft.

That said, at times the medieval cruelty is a little hard to take. It often feels too, as if the medieval torture is used as a vehicle to inject a sense of realism into the franchise. What it does instead, is become distasteful and tiresome. Just as tiring is the rather drawn out and predictable story lines that, in and of themselves, are not too different to any other found in this genre.

For me Game of Thrones is different but only just manages to stand out from the crowd. Its popular but then series of this kind tap into a genre with a strong, well established tradition and following. For me however, this fact doesn't justify elevating the series to the lofty status many other reviewers have given it. Seven out of ten from me."
331,"Do I think this series is currently the best on TV? Yes I do. Every aspect is spot on. I haven't even touched the books, but this show makes me feel like I don't even need to. The characters all have an extreme amount of depth (despite the massive cast), and the plot leaves you wanting more with each and every episode. I've turned several friends onto this series and have yet to have one not fall in love with it. We've gotten to the point that each year after the season finally we become deeply depressed until the new season begins. That may not be healthy, but this obsession is just another testament to how amazing GoT really is.I don't really want to give anything away, so I'll stop here. If anyone is debating whether to start watching, don't hesitate!"
332,"as the summary says, this show is pretty much one of a kind, and anyone who hasn't seen it yet and likes good shows in general should watch a few episodes at least to give it a try at the very least(it simply hooks you in in the first few episodes ). I won't divulge the story or give away spoilers, because I wouldn't won't anyone to spoil it for me as the story simply is so well crafted, that you just want more once you start watching it. To give some of my own input why I really loved it, let me say that it doesn't take the classical route of pretty much 90% of TV series ever made having a main character around whom the whole story evolves (and you know they are immortal or immune to the bad stuff that can happen and should happen in any series in order to give it that drama factor that makes a series draggable for more then a season or 2 to make it worthwhile watching and not bore you to death up until the moment you stop watching it...yeah it happened to me with ""Fringe""), but instead it shows you this magnificent non Hollywood world- environment/storyline where anything can happen...and it does!...and this is something that kept me and still does to this series and can't wait to see the next season (if you are wondering about how much I watched, just compare the review date with the series release...I am always up to date watching it :-) )"
333,"this show deserves 10 stars, and if i could give it 10+ stars then i would. Its the only show so far i have seen which leaves me hanging till next episode and so on. This show is a complete marvel.

And all the characters have portrayed their roles very well and so is the presentation of the show.

The story is pure ungodly in nature, something I've never seen or cant think of. and so is the execution of this story. I am amazed who's gonna win the game of thrones at last?

I recommend this show to anyone who wants some real steel. But beware, Don't START LOVING THE CHARACTERS OR YOU'LL CRY IN PAIN LIKE ME!!!"
334,"I have been a Game of Thrones fan way before I saw the actual series. I have had the privilege to read the books (some more than once) and I find the series one of the best written works ever. The TV series on the other hand digresses (naturally) from some topics. Even then, it is one of the best series I have ever watched! Tyrion Lannister for me is by far the best character on the show. He is witty, charming and multifaceted; the fact that Peter Dinklage has successfully managed to capture and emulate. There are several other characters; Cersai, Jon Snow, Arya and Danyerys who stand out.

All in all, the one of the best series to watch!!"
335,"HBO has really outdone themselves this time by ordering 'Game of Thrones'! Several months ago I refused to watch this show because I don't like the fantasy genre, but i decided to buy the first episode on iTunes, then I became addicted. I ordered HBO and watched it on demand. This show has everything: violence, drama, sex, and surprising moments. 'Game of Thrones' is an outstanding idea. The writing, acting, directing, and effects are unbelievable. But a lot of main characters die very upsetting and shocking deaths. I recommend this show to anyone who loves violent dramas. But head's up: there is a lot of graphic sex and nudity. That's why it is on HBO."
336,"Its heartwarming to finally see the budgets that go into blockbuster movies finally making its way to TV series.

Game of thrones is addictive to say the least, the vast amount of important charterers (not even the nerdiest of nerds could name them all) and each character having a detailed plot line and plenty of screen time means there are plenty of favorites to pick from. But don't start latching onto your favorite just yet because what keeps Game of Thrones so griping is that no character is safe. George R.R. Martin has had me at many occasions saying ""what the ef just happened"" or ""shouting NO NO NOOOO!"" as i watch my favorite character whom i thought was invincible getting the Axe.

Anyway overall i would recommend this series to anyone and everyone (I have) because it is truly one of the greats and will sit on the top 5 TV series list for quite some time - 10/10"
337,"I go through life constantly recommending new and old movies, books,music, TV shows and video games.

Quite plainly, if I was on my deathbed- and could only recommend a SINGLE piece of media once and for all time -- this would be it.

Its the best TV show I've ever seen....best books I've ever read.....best story ever told....and its not even over. If you Don't like it...?...well you're just wrong and that's all there is to it.

I could write 1000 more lines but I simply don't feel I need to...my recommendations are as good as guarantees....I will work to try and establish that reputation I have in the real world, here on IMDb. Figured I would first establish the top of the list and the ''commandments'', if you will, before I wage a crusade about things like how Adam Sandlers performance in 'punch drunk love' is one of the most underrated of all time. :)"
338,"This is one of the better shows I've seen in a long time. I'm a huge fan of the book series, and had my doubts about its adaptation to a TV show. But it certainly exceeded my expectations. The casting is great, and the acting is superb, especially for having such a huge cast. Michelle Fairley is incredible as Catelyn Stark, but let's not forget about Peter Dinklage as Tyrion or Jack Gleeson's perfect portrayal of Joffrey. Heck, I like them all. It's a perfect mix of drama and action, and some of the visuals (especially the Wall) are simply stunning. I've just finished Season 1 and am so excited to start the second season. Winter is coming!!!"
339,"I can say, that Game of Thrones is the best TV show I ever watched. Better than, House, Heroes, 24 or even Dexter. Although, I have to admit, that by the first episode I wasn't really fond of the show, it even annoyed me little, because I expected it more to be like Lord of the Rings. If you want to watch the series because you liked Sean Bean in Peter Jackson's trilogy, then Game of Thrones will be disappointing for you. It is something entirely different, and although it is, as well, in the fantasy genre, its style can not be compared to The Lord of the Rings. It's much darker, bloodier, has a lot more swearing and nudity. So, if you expect to see some fun adventure like the movie trilogy stated above, avoid this show. Because, I have to say, I hated the first episode, because it disappointed me so much. I ceased watching the show even, but when I learned it was nominated for Golden Globe, I thought I'd give it a second chance. And I'm glad I did.

The story is good, the actors are fantastic, the intro and theme music are amazing and the art direction and costume designs are also masterful. My favorites in the show were Tyrion Lannister (the amazing Peter Dinklage), Eddard Stark (the always great Sean Bean) and Daenerys Targarien (the fantastic Emilia Clarke). The two people I literally loathed were Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey whom I don't really like) and her annoying little brat, Joffrey Baratheon (played by Jack Gleeson, that kid with the annoying face from Batman Begins). Mark Addy was very funny, also Aidan Gillen and Kit Harington did very good jobs as well.

I didn't read the book, but I liked the story and the drama very much. It was interesting to see a fantasy more about politics and the relationship of people, than the actual adventure. I would've liked more action though, I hated when they faded out of a whole battle scene just because Tyrion fell unconscious, but that's maybe because that's how it was done in the book or the creators didn't have enough money or time. Anyway, it's a great show, but it needs a bit more of fighting and battle. And a little less nudity wouldn't go amiss either. I don't see the need for it, so why show cocks and tits in every episode? If I wanted to see that, I'd go watch porn. Maybe the director was just horny."
340,"For those of you who love fantasy watching game of thrones is essential, and for the stereotypes who view fantasy as a tale of magic and princes, thrones will change your ideas completely. Game of thrones is an epic fantasy with an incredible character driven narrative and set against an epic backdrop of violence, nudity and sex. It's essentially a tale between 7 feuding families fighting for dominion over the mythical land of Westeros and the fascinating struggle for power that ensues. The plot is full of twists and turns that makes for a compelling drama, that is set in some of the most stunning locations witnessed on TV. Breathtaking location like the frozen fortress of the Nights Watch and the rats nest of a capital that is Kings Landing, provide the viewer with plenty of eye candy, whilst confirming this shows status as the most ambitious piece of work ever to grace TV. The production values and high quality script writing both contribute to the overall quality of the show, with quotes like ""Try to penetrate the enigma that is me"" and ""Winter is coming"" soon becoming common household phrases and typifying the quality of the people who work on the show. However it's the characters and actors who portray them, that make this show truly great. From the witty dwarf Tyrion Lannister played by the excellent Peter Dinklage, to the noble Ned Stark played by the legendary Sean Bean,to the feisty Daenerys Targaeryan played by the beautiful Emilia Clarke, thrones oozes quality in the character and acting department. Even some of the supposedly minor characters like the slippery informant Varys,the loudmouthed GreatJohn Umber, the mindless oaf Hodor and the infamous mercenary Bronn all manage to be intriguing in their own way, which highlights the vast array of unique characters thrones has. Thrones manages to keep the audience emotionally invested in its various characters, whether you are rooting for the honorable Ned or cursing at the scheming Lord Baelish,there is a character everyone can relate to. Overall thrones is a sophisticated adult fantasy that doesn't hold back, and HBO must be commended for their faithful adaptation of the a song of ice and fire series of books. The sheer gore and sexual activities encompassed in the series makes it a uniquely entertaining experience and not one for the feint hearted. Lord of the rings this certainly isn't, game of thrones reinvents the fantasy genre in a stylish sort of way, which is a credit to author George RR Martin and show runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss."
341,"I read reviews of people complaining about F-Words and Porn not being needed for storytelling and F-Words aren't for medieval genre's and so on and so forth. They clearly don't understand that this happens in an alternative universe where anything and everything is possible, F-Words and Porn, having sex with whores is an extremely important for explaining how character's are, they're attitudes and actions say everything.

I watched the first episode and was very surprised, got myself the next 9 hours and watched it in 9 hours, I was left astounded. Now I did not read the books, which made it very difficult for me to understand the story and plot the first viewing, I was confused some of the time and things didn't make sense to me. I made myself familiar with the characters and the history of the land of Westeros, the Houses and families, the second viewing of the entire season I was even more astounded. This is the type of production that makes you connect with the characters, extremely good writing this is.

Give yourself a look at Game of Thrones, with an open mind, focus and a taste for good storytelling, you will not be left disappointed. Unless of course this whole type of thing simply doesn't enter your taste of genre, but then again, why are you here?"
342,"The goal is to periphrasis and deploy the immorality among families, and disseminate porn between relative as an usual act for normal humans in a typical commercial show.. however everyone knows those things happened in that era, but the show took that as an advantage to promote it when it could been done in an appropriate and more convenient way instead immorality. Sorry but this is my opinion."
343,I have seen a lot of good shows and a lot of bad shows. I do not think that i have ever seen a show this bad. I tried to watch the first season and it was awful. Very stupid and boring. I continued to watch it because i heard so much good things about it but i just could not get myself to get to the fifth episode. I am personally not a fan of shows like this but it looked cool but a complete disappointment all around a terrible show. The only good part is the sex and the boobs if that stuff was not in the show then this show would have never been as popular all people want to see is Emilia Clarkes boobs. This show is worse than any show i could think of. Also the dwarf is pretty coo also
344,"I'm making this review as a TV-show fan, despite i have read the books.

I think this series started simply amazing. The first 3 seasons are proof of this. The first introduces us to the world of Game of Thrones, its characters and its exquisite political plot, so well elaborated that many are surprised that it is a work of fantasy. Likewise, it broke the schemes of what we are used to seeing in terms of fantasy in an audiovisual medium, and the realism impregnated in the series, as well as the eloquent and well-placed cliff-hangers at the end of certain episodes made it a pleasant pleasure to See and enjoy. The second season, true, slower than the first, provides us with an even more elaborate political plot than the first, as well as the problems of a world at war. In addition, the characters show a great evolution and raise the main problems of the cusp of the series: The third season.

This season shows us in addition to a clear evolution of the characters, the evolution of the series environment. It shows how the world around the characters has changed due to the actions and events occurred. It shows us that bad decisions have weight both in the real world and in a fantastic world, and as the world of Game of Thrones is so crude, the consequences will be harder and worse. In addition, it contains the most emblematic moments of the series and, the one that I think, the best chapter of the series: Kissed by Fire.

The fourth season, although downgraded from the previous three, gave us still exciting and tense moments, brilliant moments of political plot and one of the best battles seen on television. However, it seems that not everything can be kept in such a good state.

The fifth season is the point where the series radically twists its way. Plots previously masterfully worked, begin to receive easy resolutions, consistency is lost in many of them and others are completely forgotten in the sense that they are not given the treatment they deserve and become simply stuffed. The characters are stagnant without the evolution shown in previous seasons and even begin to decline in quality, giving us some fantasy cliché characters. The quality of the episodes fell horribly, having a lousy pace and being the only salvageable of several ones only the end (a cliff-hanger). The scripts in addition to establishing a poor continuity, have deplorable lines that honestly, I can't imagine someone writing it and thinking it is good. The perfect series happened to be a series with chapters of filling, inconsistent plots and little interesting personages.

While the sixth showed an improvement to all this, it still has clear issues of script and continuity, plus some totally ridiculous moments and wasted characters. Game of Thrones is an exceptional series, but these last seasons have made its valuation fall considerably. I really hope it gets better by next season.

345,"like its inspiration material the lord of the rings the game of thrones is much ado about nothing .and here is why, where in lord of the rings the story relied upon magic, luck and eagles saving the day , the game of thrones in itself does not have a real story. characters are introduced in flooding way and all of them seem one dimensional , and here is why. take eddard stark for example, this man is head of an ancient family who have survived so many things , he must have inherited some political savvy eh ? no, he is stupid of course his idiocy is painted as honor. joffrey is pure evil there is no background for him he is just evil, cersei is evil, Jamie is evil, balon Gregory? evil , his children? evil, stark children either cruel and dumb like Robb or just evil like arya, the one that is not evil is related to magic dany ? don't even want to start on that one she is evil , cruel and a hypocrite to the bone i can go on and on but why bother the truth to be told every one in this story is evil and more importantly dumb , like how can tywin lannister a shrewd and calculating politician make so many mistake and create so many enemies? the other thing that bothers me and makes this series unwatchable is the amount of sex and nudity , like how many times do have watch prostitutes of westeros ? how come women have show us their boobs five times in a minutes? what is so appealing about sexual deviance? for me the answer is non. and finally o come back to my starting point, the series ( books and TV series )have no story at all . try to picture it a lot of people have been killing each other and now most of them are dead , so what ? where is the point in that ? and the others or white walkers story is so dumb that can not be taken seriously it seems the writer of the books and the series as well couldn't come up with anything special as major turning event so he went on to right about dragons and ice zombies and people with silver hair and purple eyes and sex ."
346,"I had very high expectations from this series and I believed that it will (like most TV series) absolutely ruin the book. And I couldn't have been more wrong! Where do I start...

The cast is great, though not amazing with one exception - Sean Bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the North, Eddard Stark. The setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! Some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogues are just as they should be. Now to get to the part most people are interested in: What is this? What can I expect of the series?

This is a great TV presentation of Martins epic books. However if you have read the book than you can be disappointed if some characters are not nearly as what you have imagined them by reading. There are two main problems - Red Viper Martel of Dorne and Sir Loris Tyrell who are the best heroes of their fractions manly characters who we gay in TV which is disgusting."
347,"I haven't read any of the books and therefore I wasn't a fan of this series beforehand. This means that my review is based purely on the television series itself, regardless whether or not it stays true to the books.

When I watched the first episode of ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO I immediately knew this was going to be a one of a kind. First of all the magnitude of this production is nothing less than what you'd expect from a Hollywood blockbuster epic. Although episode one begins with interweaving events which happen in various locations within the fictional continent of Westeros, the characters begin to emerge rather early in the story, and the likable ones are easy to engage with.

Most of the actors are very good at portraying their character, and it's only the odd one here and there who seems a little bit off, but having said that with such a large cast and so many day players it is expected. One of my personal favorite actors in this series is Sean Bean as Ned Stark, and it's a real shame that we don't get to see more of him after season one. Peter Dinklage is simply great as Tyrion Lannister, and I quite liked Jason Momoa's character, Khal Drogo.

What's beautiful about this series is that you truly never know what's going to happen next. Anyone could be killed, there are no ""heroes"" in this story, everyone is vulnerable in some way."
348,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Game of Thrones"" (2011-) is arguably the best current show in a world. It has everything to be on top, and it is. I won't say nothing new that wasn't already said before, but still...

This is brilliant show from start till finish, in every direction. Probably there wasn't a show before with this big, rich ambitious scope. Yes, it's based on amazing material, but realize it on the screen takes a guts, money and talent. No other network couldn't pull it of, except HBO. You can clearly see every dollar that was spent on screen, and usually, not in directly way - i mean the locations, settings, costumes, art design, special effects - it's all there, you can almost feel it. I won't lie, i don't like fantasy genre in general, but ""Game of Thrones"" sucks you in from the opening scene and doesn't let go. To appreciate this show you don't have read books - just enjoy the beat, small things on screen - when you will see them, the whole picture will come itself. I could talk for hours of how brilliant this thing is, but you have to see it by yourself to understand.

Overall, 4 seasons have gone, and it's a solid 10/10 for ""Game of Thrones"" - a truly unique and almost flawless adventure in every direction - it's dark, gruesome, gritty and unforgettable, a must see for everyone and even those who don't like fantasy - you won't regret it."
349,"I cannot remember a time when I've given something 10/10 but Game of Thrones deserves it.

Set in the backdrop of a fantasy land, where there are power struggles for supremacy galore! The characters are well developed and you feel you slowly get to know everyone. The beauty of this is the characters grow and you get to find out more and more about them, they become deep and intricate.

You have to stay on the ball as there are many story lines and there is much to follow, but it's worth it. It is gripping, really gripping.

The author isn't afraid to shock you, to take characters out and there's always something unexpected. Story lines continue over each episode, and it takes a while to work out what is going on in some cases, which all adds to its mystique.

I love this series, I cannot recommend it enough! Be aware there's lots of bad language, sexual scenes etc, but strangely you don't mind as it adds to realism of the story and its setting. Truly amazing work and the actors are epic in their roles, every one of them believable.

Go and watch! :-)"
350,"What more can be said about this that already hasn't? If you're sat reading this review wondering weather or not you want to sit down and watch this then stop reading and watch it.

For those of you that have chosen to carry on reading then let me just try and begin to tell you just how good this show is.

From the very first moment you watch this show and see the opening credits you will be propelled into a world of betrayal, love, honour, adultery, blood, guts, war, dragons, mystery, and a vast army of different characters bringing this all together for you on your screen.

It truly is a feast for the eyes. If you want all the above in one TV show then is it.

So go out, buy it and watch it."
351,"Just about everything in this series is phenomenal. It is geared for adults so the nudity, violence and gore might offend viewers. Some gory scenes could have been left out. My wife is not into scifi, but she loves the Renaissance aspect of the series.

The plot is great and you may have to watch a couple of times to get it sorted out. Casting is phenomenal. The actors play their part well. Tyrion is intelligent and witty. The villains are evil, heros are commendable, and the inept and insane are just that.

A lot on the naughty side, I enjoy the ""all natural"" women. I was actually surprised at the amount of flesh is shown, but sex sells.

We await season 2 and hope it is as good as the first."
352,"I've seen by accident that the novel was turned into a TV series. I watched all parts in in two rows and now i'm unhappy, of course April is that far away.

I don't want to give a summary, i just want to say this: As i read the books, i thought that would be great as a movie like Lord of the rings. As series it's even better, of course the story isn't shortened.

All fantasy series i've seen so far, are made cheap and lack of a good story. And with fantasy, i mean real fantasy, sword fighting and dragons. This is the adaption of a very good novel and it's realized well.

For all fans of fantasy a MUST SEE. For all others ... forget what you have seen so far (except for rare stuff like Lord of the rings and Willow), try this out. May you will find your way to fantasy!"
353,"Intricate and compelling, very well written. There is probably not more I could say that haven't already being said.

I just want to remark on how well developed all the characters are, even the bad guys which is rare. I especially enjoyed the women characters of the show, all portrayed as exceptional and strong-willed. You may disapprove of their actions, like the queen's incestuous relation, Lady Stark's prejudice against her husband's bastard son, or Daenerys Targaryen's submissiveness at the beginning of the show, but you must admire the strength, ambition, and determination of these ladies. Not like other shows where women are simply weak, victims, or crazy cartoonish evil.

And my absolute favourite character is the imp, Lord Tyrion Lannister, quick-witted and clever. What a refreshing show.

There better be a season 2 or I will cancel HBO."
354,This series will hook you in by the end of the first episode. I didn't read the books prior to watching the series but I have finished the 1st novel now and love it! I have enjoyed this series more than any series HBO has done since the Sopranos and Rome. HBO did a great job of transferring the viewer in to the seven kingdoms. It appears that the writers for the series took every 80 pages of the novel and used them to each episode. Very true the books and may be the best series adaptation ever done. It is truly my hope that HBO continues this series in the same manner. If they continue to stay true to the novel and use 70 to 90 pages as an episode I will not miss an episode. Thanks again HBO!
355,"My vote of 8 is just beginning as I'm watching only first season in Russian language. I can say I believe in future 10 of 10 to this Creation! You can see a lot of human feelings like friendship, envy, hate, greed, woman psychology at queen's throne and her power!!! Always respect your Queens! - as they are your last and strongest wall behind you who won't let you FALL! I'm always while watching movie trying to find philosophy of the author or director and all of action and high budget searchers suggest this! I'm not official voter, but I am man! Man who loves his life and believes that life is amazing! Wish you all learn from this series something to GOOD!!!!! Big thanks to creators of this movies and thanks all of you who have read my opinion about this movie and understood me, because understanding of written is very difficult comparing to speaking with person! Have a nice watch all!"
356,"arguably the best TV show ever, from intense action,violence,emotion,drama,suspense it contains a lot more that anyone could have imagined. i heard about it and i started watching and man it is so addictive, you can't live without it . man i wish this could keep running for very long. acting of peter dinklage will also blow you away."
357,"The dragon mother storyline is the only one that really captures my attention.

The rest is a lavish soap opera. It ups the bar in production values and provocativeness, but is essentially a trashy, meandering romance novel that HBO successfully passed off as a pop culture phenomenon.

There is really no direction or character development to speak of. Peter Dinklage manages to inject some nuance into his performance, which appears as brilliant acting relative to all the other stone faces, of whom no director seems to make any hefty demands. Lots of great lines fall to the wayside while efforts are spent instead on costumes and sets. Evil characters are just evil, and making us truly understand them isn't remotely a priority.

I don't hate it. I sometimes hate myself for rather enjoying it, in the way humanity's less endearing qualities force us to grow addicted to juicy gossip and reality shows. I wouldn't call this a ""good"" show though.

On the upside, after watching an episode, everything I think and read takes on a posh British accent, which adds a touch of refinement to my American lifestyle."
358,"Unbelievable everything! The dynamics between the plot and the characters are outstanding. It always makes me wanting more! The character development is one of its best qualities, but there are so many other great things about it that I just feel overwhelmed by its glorious perfectness. The story line is always exciting and unpredictable. The writers and directors do an excellent job at putting the viewer in the character's shoes, giving empathy to all the characters and their decisions; the good and bad. The special effects are fantastic but not over used like so many Michael Bay type films. Sometimes, it is so realistic, you feel disgusted and-or relieved, however this only exemplifies its poignant nature. Real truths are brought out. Even though it is a fictional world, the characters still act like real people in dire situations. This is truly a masterpiece."
359,"This show is a phenomenon.It is so new and original.Very few shows can claim to be as great as this one.It gets everything right.Magnificent visuals,amazing performances and shocking twists around every corner.Even the child actors are really good.Every single season improves on the previous one.The characters are so awesome.My favourite is Tyrion Lannister.Peter Dinklage is amazing and is easily the best actor in the entire cast.This show has to be the most complicated and intricate show ever.And that is what makes it awesome.My favourite season is the fifth one.

Season 6 is going on right now,and the stakes are super high.This show shows no signs of running out of steam.By far the best on TV."
360,"For far too long did I put off watching this series because of my pre-conceived notion that it was a re-hashed Lord of the Rings rip-off. I have a feeling that many people who have not yet experienced Game of Thrones are those who have the same misconceptions that I had. I did enjoy The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I found this TV series to be on a completely different level.

Sean Bean's performance as the steely-eyed Lord Eddard Stark is commendable, but it is Peter Dinklage and his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, the witty and wise dwarf born in to privilege, that steals the show for me.

It is very rare that a TV show can truly give the viewer a roller-coaster of emotions, but Game of Thrones certainly lives up to that billing. There are scenes that will make you laugh (though this is far from a comedy), scenes that will leave you sobbing, and scenes that will have you screaming at the action on the screen. Episodes will finish and leave you with your jaw on the floor, eager to find out what happens next time.

In short, you do not have to be a fan of epic fantasy to enjoy this series. If you are a fan of emotive story lines and fantastic acting along with some amazing special effects, then this is definitely for you."
361,"""Best"" TV series ever watched , and will ""Ever"" be made."
362,"A whole new theme makes the perfect enterance. And boy oh boy they certainly now how to churn out dialogues of highest class.

Acting was as usual best we have seen in any series . Nude Scenes were probably not necessary. They all bombed their secrets on each other. Loved that aspect of revealing upfront. Jon Dany relationship is at the verge of an inflection point. Graphics are at their best. And that last arrival was so awesome.

So one of the best season premiere!!!!"
363,"I have sat here for almost 20 minutes thinking of a reason why this show deserves less then 10 stars. I cant find a single reason. A perfect score can only be given once in my opinion and it jist doesnt get any better, let alone favorably comparable."
364,"If you do not like this show, your opinion on anything is irrelevant"
365,"Dragons, Kings, Queens, love, fighting, magic, zombies, plot twists, WHAT ELSE COULD YOU POSSIBLY ASK FOR??? Literally the best show I've ever seen!!!!! The Mother of Dragons is the best part of every single episode, oh, and John Snow of course! I would love to live in a world where they ruled our 'kingdom'. Lol. The visuals are amazing, the acting is breathtaking, the stories are INCREDIBLE. Nothing negative to say whatsoever....and I usually am not a fan of magical, time period movies and shows with dragons and kingdoms. But Game of Thrones is truly remarkable!!!! It's like nothing else I've ever watched... and I've watched a lot. A MUST SEE!!!!!"
366,This is the best series i have ever seen I think this series have a lot of good thinks we can see clear as water
367,"Quick review of GOT is, it is fantastic, probably will be regarded as one of the best series' in history. The story of this show (while differing in places to the books) is an epic tale of fantasy in a medieval setting. The scale of this show and effort put into it puts a lot of high budget Hollywood film's to shame. I applaud David Benioff And D. B Weiss for creating this masterpiece.

Rant Time: Now on to all of the people who have tried in vain to make this show go under a 9. I cannot comprehend why any person is rating this show a 1 or a 2. The cinematography and effects alone make that objectivly wrong, to anyone with eyes. I felt physically bad reading people say this show has no story or substance, or worst of all, that it's boring. I understand that people may not like this show, and that's fine. But some of he arguments these people give tells me they have no brain cells."
368,"Do yourself a favor Watch it even if you are not a fan of fantasy/sci-fi genre. The storyline is well written, cast is perfect and spectacular scenes. This show has set the bar so high for television."
369,Just simply amazing! Keeps you constantly guessing and draws you in. There's a reason it's so popular - it's because it's so bloody good!
370,"Do not believe any of those negative reviews. I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.

Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.

There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.

It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.

Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.

The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.

After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like ""Merlin"" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.

Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this."
371,"Words can not describe how great this show is, best fantasy drama ever and if I could only watch it again without knowing anything, it would be one of best feelings ever.

I would love that this show never ends but sadly as I write this final season is here... If for some reason you didn't watch this show, and you love fantasy and drama, big rich world with amazing story, you are in for treat. Binge watch it, enjoy it, it one in million TV show. Easiest 10/10 ever, and also sets bar very very high for fantasy/drama/sci-fi shows, as fan of fantasy movies/shows, I will be sad when it ends, as I doubt that I will see something even close to this show in years after this show ends."
372,This is the best thing I've ever watched. Watch it is all I can say!!
373,"Dense interweaving storytelling with a lot of different motivations for different characters, which makes the overarching storylines a lot more unpredictable than one could imagine."
374,"Not sure my vocabulary is vast enough to truly list the superlatives that this series deserves!

From the opening music and scenes GOT is a Class above most tv series hands down! I have watched every episode of every season and I can say hand on heart it has been the best acting,script,cinematography,special effects, etc I have ever had the pleasure to watch. So much so that when the last instalments of the series are shown,I intend to watch the entire series all over again from the start . Star rating is not high enough as I can only give it 10 and it's worth a lot more"
375,I was read to give this a 10/10 to the acting great plot and then season 7 happened. The plot got just really bad. It started not to make sense I'm not saying the show really does but it broke its own rules. Also in season 7 I just felt like I was watching a super hero movie wich is not what I wanted to see. Hopefully season 8 will be better so I can give this a high rating cuz seasons 1-6 10/10
376,"Enough said. There is no better combination of acting, visual effects, dialogue, and character development."
377,"There's Tv Shows and Theres Game of Thrones. An absolutely STUNNING, thrilling television Masterpiece."
378,"Game of Thrones isn't just a television show. No. It's a community, lifestyle, religion even. There are no flaws in this fantastic internationally acclaimed masterpiece! Music, acting, dialogue, costumes, script, cinematography... the list goes on. A must watch for intelligent viewers who appreciate quality and smart television. Go. Now. And. Begin. Your. Journey. Of. Game. Of. Thrones! Become entranced in the world of Westeros where betrayal, romance, murder, mystery, thriller, happiness, intelligence, nudity, fantastic plots, emotionally well done musical scores and just Oscar worthy performances all takes place.

10/10+ and Highly Recommend!"
379,"Simple as that, best show ever. A must see. totallly amazing and i love it. Since season 1 to season 7, its just perfect. I cant wait for the last season coming in 2019, i´m sure the wait will be totally worth it."
380,"It will be more a comment than a review - lots of information can be found, also recommendation's. But...

I read every book before - 1 season was almost perfect - in mater of keeping script accurate to story from book. Second should be a warning sign for everybody ""watch out ! I'm starting to be a different story"" Third season was a nail to the coffin - in the middle, about episode 5 or 6 I start to suspect that Elvis Presley with Yeti will jump out from the next corner. Maybe We will see Yoda or Lord Wader in this production soon.I don't want to spoil anything so no further details. I understand the needs of some extra sub stories to build tension or explain some more complicated trails but making complete fiction is a different story.

I strongly recommend to everybody - read the book carefully - it's worth it ! You will discover a different , and amazing story.

What about HBO production - really good when We are talking about TV entertainment. I watch every episode and I enjoy it. ( apart of script- to-book accuracy )"
381,"I'll keep this review short because I doubt there's anything I can say that hasn't already been said. Basically, I was drawn to this series because it appeared to be a cable TV version of 3/4ths of the video games I play (Skyrim, Dragon Age, etc) and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. I watched all of the first 3 seasons within a weeks period of time on demand, and it seems that each season only got better. At first I was daunted by the number of characters and locations, but it really didn't take long to get to know the people... at least the important players. The characters have real depth, and it's hard to completely hate or completely love any of them, because most of them have good and bad traits, just as we all do in real life. I recommend this to anyone who is into fantasy stories or RPG video games!"
382,"""HBO has done it again"" seems to be the consensus on this new HBO show, an adaptation of George R.R. Martin's best-selling book series, A Song of Ice & Fire. But I've noticed a pattern. It seems to be coming from the type of people that ate the last season of Lost out of the writers's hands, or found ""The Walking Dead"" to be the most riveting 6 hours of television they've ever seen. I've seen 8 of the 10 episodes of this season so far, and I can safely say that it's a disaster. Many people say that the show is faithful to the book but they seem to be only concerned with simple plot points. Character A kills Character B, Twist #1 leaves viewers wanting to find out what happens next, etc. But where are the details? 10 episodes, 10 hours. Each episode covers 10% of the book, i.e. 7 chapters per episode. And yet the writers find a way to only scratch the surface. I'm almost convinced that they speed read through the book to get it written in time for filming.

If you want a solid, well written season of television, look elsewhere. If you want a jumbled mess of amateurish editing, directing, and pacing, look no further, you found your best option. The show's main problem lies in the pacing. It is absolutely dreadful. Prepare yourself for abrupt cuts to credits, clunky transitioning, misdirections due to bad writing, the list goes on. Each episode is just one event after another. There is no common theme to tie anything together. The pilot races through the chapters to get to the first twist in the book and use it as a cliffhanger. The difference lies in the impact. The characters involved were only given a few minutes of screen time total. There are episodes where months pass and the writers lazily let the audience know by having people say ""It's been a month since..."" The two main locations featured are 30 days apart, yet characters come and go as if they were neighboring towns. There are several scenes that last 5-7 minutes long, and almost all of those scenes are lifeless conversations between two characters.

The show would benefit greatly if everyone just stopped talking for 30 seconds. There's no time to breathe. Who really cares about history lessons that date back to 500 years? The writers spend time talking about decayed skeletons just because the book did. They don't realize what should be included and excluded. There are quite a few scenes of children being taught or reminded of their history lessons by their elders. But it doesn't stop there. The genius writers have more tricks up their sleeves, including a minimum of one scene per episode involving sex and exposition. Sexposition. Nice to see that the writer's respect their audience. One 5 minute scene involves gratuitous soft-core porn while a character reveals his intentions and babbles on about history and names, but the moans of two women pleasuring each other drown him out.

Another problem is that the writers dedicate a lot of screen time characterizing secondary characters. In the book, they weren't main characters for a reason. To develop other characters. Sure, they're important characters, and they do game-changing things that affect everyone, but they're a backdrop. They move the story along, and most seem one-dimensional. It's not until later in the other books that they take center stage and show their intentions, their motivations, their reasoning, etc. In the scene that I described above, the character speaking over the moans is a scheming bastard in the book. But you never know what he's up to or why. Yet in the show, he has more screen time than most of the main cast. Some of the characters only get mentioned a few times in the books yet here they're featured prominently, revealing things that don't get revealed until much later in the series.

The show does a terrible job at portraying the world the books build. The lack of scope is jarring. Seeing battles with 20 soldiers instead of 20,000 isn't exactly ""epic"" as the kids like to say. As an example, there's an army of 100,000 across the sea that the king is concerned about. But in every scene involving them marching, at the head of the group are old men and fat women. It's inexcusable. The extras (in any scene) are so bad that it's distracting. The lack of direction in this show is unbelievable.

Most of the action scenes are very poorly executed and feel like they came from a low budget TV sci-fi movie. They feel almost as lifeless and rehearsed as the rest of the show, so it brings nothing new or exciting. The weather is always sunny, there are almost no night scenes, no dynamic camera movement, and way too many re-used sets. The world is even more lifeless than the characters. The cities don't feel like cities but rather like sets. One particular fight scene is clearly a sound stage, with no shadows or natural lighting. The sound editing is horrendous, so don't watch with headphones. The music is mediocre, and it doesn't surprise me, seeing as how the composer was hired 6 weeks before the pilot aired.

All in all, the show is just downright bad with little good. For those who haven't read the books, you might as well give the show a chance. It'll be easier to excuse some of the flaws if you don't have source material to compare it to. If you aren't looking for the next ""Mad Men"" or ""The Wire"", then maybe you'll enjoy the show. If you have read the books, well prepare to see them get butchered."
383,"i am shocked to see what have become of this show,how can anyone who has read the books can like this second season garbage?when i read the second book i was in a trance for days,and now watching this stupidity it makes my heart cry,i know its always impossible to match the quality of a book but seriously...this season 2 is just plain bogus.i was happy after watching season 1 that it was a good try,but now the show is going to dogs,please stop making this filth and try doing justice to the books,the books are awesome,please someone stop this nuisance.The show makers changed some things from the book in season 1, OK i can understand that,but in season 2 they have changed the entire feel of the book,most of the characters are thrown out of sync from the way martin portrayed them,its like the writers of the show are only concerned about the main plot lines of the book and rest they are spewing out themselves,i never criticize anything or anyone as i feel its not right but please this time i can not stop myself,season 2 is really really BAD."
384,"After two episodes I still couldn't get into the series, there is no emotional buildup or character development. The rest of the series I fast-forwarded through, dwelling about 5 to 7 minutes on each episode. I stopped in episode 6.

Here's what you get:

-One-dimensional stereotyped characters ""we don't care"" for

-infinite boring dialogs -bleak film sets devoid of modern visuals and CGI

-animal killings: Nytheria (wolf) and the beheading of a horse early on. This wouldn't bother me if the wolf hadn't been the one likable character on the show -tons of bleak looking medieval stuff

-a storyline excruciatingly following the book series

-nudity could aid the series, in GoT it is misplaced and women are debased (e.g. A knight just beheaded someone and proclaims to his newfound lad whether he would like to lay with a woman now, as he usually does after gorefests - RIGHT in front of the queen). That's the general attitude towards females of the whole series

""Spartacus"" is female emancipation compared to this show

-dated. The series might as well have been made three decades ago. There is nothing revolutionary. It is purely fan driven.

-Devoid of fantasy (Normally I would like that, except in GoT this means more endless hard to follow dialogue on the backdrop of beak-looking sets).

The best proof that this show is only watched by fanboys and girls can be seen directly in the IMDb ratings. 98% rate the show a 10/10. Fantasy at its best."
385,Im so sick of hey game of t is so awesome hhhhaaaa uuuhhh... No its a sick perverted showing uneseserly nudity perverzion violenc sodomy etc . what in a Gods name u people find good in this show its totally disgusting
386,"I saw the 1st season. Very very boring. I think I have wasted 10 hours of my life, for nothing, by watching this series. The first episode was a bit promising, but later on nothing. So i saw the rest of the 1st season hoping for some improvement, which never ""came"". The script and the plot is nothing special and very very slow. Casting is also poor except, Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage. The production gave me the impression of a low budget film. Too much blood, without any war scenes. Too many sex scenes probably too boost up the ratings. Compared to the Pilars of the Earth (8 mini TV series), The game of Thrones is at least 3 ""steps"" lower. I really do not understand the IMDb high score of 9.4, No way ! There is no point for me to wait for season 2."
387,"After seeing hundreds of ridiculous reviews calling Game of Thrones 'a masterpiece', 'the finest piece of TV ever' etc, I felt as though I had to explain that this is simply not the case. A 9.5 rating on IMDb is baffling, to be honest, as there are literally tens of thousands of titles that deserve a better rating than this series. Having watched the first several episodes of S1 and selected other episodes from various other seasons, I can confirm that this series really DOES NOT live up to its reputation. Not by a long way. Truthfully, I actually found it rather dull, and lacking anything of real interest. I'm convinced that about half of Game of Thrones's audience is most likely teenagers who simply watch due to the large amount of nudity/sex scenes, because that's really the most notable aspect of it, and that isn't even necessarily a positive factor. I've read some of the books by George RR Martin, and they were far more enjoyable than this, so if you want to know the Game of Thrones story, I strongly advise you to read the books rather than sit through 60 hours of this nonsense. It's nothing but a chore. But if you're looking for a TV series that could actually, realistically be considered a masterpiece, there are many other and let's face it, infinitely superior ones. Breaking Bad. True Detective. Lost. These are just several of the shows that I guarantee you would find far better than this, and they prove that Game of Thrones getting a 9.5 rating is, quite frankly, a joke. If you're thinking of watching it, please don't waste your time. There are better shows out there."
388,"Incest, rape and gore does not equal entertainment. There is nothing redeeming about this show except for the sets, and non violent special effects, which are beautiful, but not worth sitting through the show for."
389,"First of all, ill say that I didn't read the book, nor did I ever heard of it. Second; I watched the first 6 episodes so far (thats 6 hours).

Most reviews are mainly positive, but many of those are written by the book readers. If one feels that you have to read the book to enjoy the series this review is not for you.

This series is a drag. I think thats the best way to describe it. Its a never ending introduction of people whom may become important later or whom may not, you don't know for sure. Its about intrigue, backstabbing, leadership, honor, good, evil all that.. but it doesn't deliver. Some things happen, and if it does the show will definitely let you know ""something"" happened. Even if its not that special it will become the main part of the story for to long.

Six episodes is almost 6 hours, nothing 'epic'/'grand' happened. All six hours is talk and no show. You might see a sword fight or two (not much more), but no battles or some breath holding scenes. Even those who love this series cannot deny this. There are no real scenes in it, which will 'take you away', in lack of better words.

So far, to me, this is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. You keep switching from story line to story line, and although they are put together nicely it just gets boring after an hour or 4. Once again I'd like to state that nothing really happens.

There is one thing this series does. It somehow keeps you interested. I think I know why. its because the story lines that are plotted out continually give you the feeling something grand is going to happen. I had that feeling since episode 1, but it never delivered. They set-up this epic wars and battles that are bound to happen, but they don't. I imagine something will happen soon enough, but its too late imo.

I am not watching dragon ball (or am I?). I don't want to watch 6 to 8 hours for one action episode. That makes it a SOAP. I am all for 'complicated'/ extended story lines, but not this. Its to much. To much characters you need to know, to much different protagonists, to much parallel story lines.

Acting wise, I am not to impressed (also not disappointed). Its hard, because there are to many lead-roles. The big roles are filled by competent actors. In this aspect they do transcend a soap, but there are many roles that are filled with lesser ones. (for me; Jaime Lannister and Jon Snow don't hit it)

I am not shy to sex-scenes. I am from The low lands and we like to make sex the main basis of all our movies, but come on. The abundant nakedness almost makes me think someone is compensating... for lack of action that is. Sex scenes are fine, but imo to much emphasis is placed on some in this series and that makes it a bit weird now and then.

To conclude; I actually don't think my comparison with dragonball, for the ones familiar, is that bad. One battle could last a season. In this case a season is comparable to the preface of a DBZ episode. It only remains interesting because they constantly talk about grand wars and actually ride to war since episode one, but the 2 out of (the?!?) three sword fights are fought with wooden swords (not kidding) and my patience is starting to evaporate soon."
390,"Once again I am in front of the TV seeing an extremely over-hyped series. I swore that I'd never do this mistake again after the last flop of trying to watch ""Heroes"" and drawing the correct conclusion that everything that is too hyped is bad.

This time the hype was overwhelming! I decided (against my gut feeling) that I try and watch whole season and continue to watch no matter what, because otherwise people would just make the CLASSICAL argument that ""You can't know if it's bad if you've only seen a few episodes"".

Actually, in fact, a very important point here is that actually all you ever need to see in order to judge is the first episode of a series, the so called ""pilot episode"". Producers know that the first impression is important and so the pilot is the most expensive episode of all. If the pilot is bad, the series is bad.

Nonetheless, I watched the whole first series. Game of Thrones is not good, it is just hyped.

The acting, music and graphics is not bad, but the story is. It is boring to watch. Episodes end with cliff hangers that promise that something exciting is going to happen in the next episode. But nothing exciting ever happens and you feel tricked.

Never again will I let my mind be hijacked by group mentality and hype."
391,"I know that i am probably in the minority here, but i do not hold game of thrones in such a high esteem as the rest of the viewers. I have not read the books so my opinion only has to do with the show as a TV product. I find the acting, the soundtrack and the atmosphere of the series amazing. But in the end, i never find myself eager to watch the next episode for some reason. I love fantasy series and i devour series with action, battles and politics. I loved Spartacus and i didn't mind the nude and sex scenes. In game of thrones though i find many scenes too disturbing. I also find that i do not care for many characters so much as i should. The first season was for me the best. Every character was given enough time, for us to learn about him and his story...But in season 2 and 3 we only see every character for a few minutes and sometimes not in every episode. I know that this is the way it is supposed to be but it keeps me from getting invested in them. Everything involves so slowly for me that in the end when i have to choose an episode from any series to watch, game of throne is almost always my final choice despite being a superior production to most shows out there right now..."
392,Why this awful thing have highest rating in IMDb ?? Now everyone like and think about foul story like this .. #worststoryever I don't what happened to the world?? why ?? I don't find any interesting fact about it. It has worst story and bad fantasy which only reveal lust. I mean what's it ???? Tell me anyone it's annoying now it has season 7 ... makes me sick. #worst #dissapointment
393,"To me this show is extremely slow for my liking. I enjoy thrillers only when they are fast-paced.

There are plenty of scenes where characters keep having a conversation for close to 20 mins and nothing substantial happens in that episode I would rather watch another thriller or horror that gives me edge of the seat thrill and does not bore me with long conversations."
394,"G.O.T. is really a Television treat to the viewers. Before I was used to watch Superhero TV Shows of WB and Marvel. And I admired how much hard work they have done and also how much money they have put into it. So that the viewers can get a phenomenal experience.

BUT G.O.T. changed my perceptions. It is so awesome and beautiful that a viewed can stick to it for a whole 1 hour. This serial has exceeded others in terms of budget , quality and entertainment. As a result it is the most watched TV show. The costumes , VFX , filming sets are beyond imagination and out of this world. And the actors too are doing full justice to there respective roles.

I usually don't write reviews on Serials and Movies. But this show is so intriguing that I have to write a review to appreciate it. It's concepts and it's story and most importantly there way of presenting this concept is exceptional. I am even out of words right now. I love almost each and everything of this show. I am an ardent supporter of this series. And I am really waiting very badly for the 7th season. Hope it doesn't ends on that."
395,"I was very excited but still quite skeptical when i found out that they're gonna adapt one of my favorite books. Book series that is, but Game Of Thrones is my favorite in the series so far. I'm an amateur screenwriter and one day i came to an idea of trying to adapt something since i've already written a couple of original screenplays. I wanted a high task and i wanted it to be a fantasy so i looked for the best fantasy on the internet and everyone said that this is it. And they were right. I read Lord Of The Rings, which is/are amazing, but this is something special and very different from anything i've ever read. All the characters are so well done, the storyline is so interesting with a whole bunch of unexpected twists, and so on... You don't even have a feeling that it's a fantasy while you're reading it. Anyway, it didn't take me long to read the book and understand that it can't be adapted. Into a movie, that is. So i gave up on adaptation, but i continued with reading the series and all i can say is i can't wait for the fifth book!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

As for the TV series, the book is more or less quite faithfully adapted. Of course, some parts are missing, some unimportant characters thrown out, most of the characters, especially young ones, a lot older than in the books and certain parts a bit changed, though they all still have the same ending, but that was to be expected. The book(s) is/are obviously a lot better, but the TV adaptation is still great. Brilliant. Amazing. Not as amazing as the book(s) but still....

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Certain actors, i must say, really don't fit their roles. Such as Jon Snow, Joffrey Lannister, Theon Greyjoy, Catelyn Stark and even Cersei i'd say, but what can you do. It shouldn't mind to those who didn't read the books. Characters that are well casted are, i think, Eddard Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Arya Stark, Brann Stark, Daenerys Targaryen, Khal Drogo, Tywin Lannister, Gregor Clegane,... There is much more of those who are not good for their roles but most of them are supporting characters so i wont mention them a lot, but the point is that casting should've been done a lot better. Joffrey, for instance, is supposed to be a very pretty kid with full lips an the actor looks like Dennis The Menace with thin lips and the most evil eyes i've ever seen. Really not good for his part even though his character is evil. Jon Snow is supposed to look way younger than the actor who plays him is, just like Sansa Stark and so on. But i guess i can go over those things since the series are really great and i'm just happy that the book(s) are being adapted in the first place.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Watch this series. They are great. Like The Godfather set in a fantasy medieval world. The Sopranos with swords and even better. My recommendation to everyone. And i just wanna say that i'm glad they didn't cut the nudity and brutality out of the series. That would really ruin everything since the books are pretty unmerciful toward it's characters and the story in general. 10 out of 10!!!!"
396,The storyline has been carved absolutely delicious and what else can you can expect from a series and whatever expectations you may have can turn out to be totally different within seconds.
397,"I love this show.

however having said this i cant ignore the fact that this show is being rushed. You will definitely see a difference in the pace the initial seasons let the time to tell a story to let ourselves be immersed in the world leading to the haphazard getting to the point kind of writing the show has taken in the current season 7 (however entertaining they take it to be).

I am disappointed but don't want anyone to miss out on this fantasy drama. It is a great show.. i just hope they give it enough credit and end it well."
398,"I love Game of thrones. I thought the first few episodes were a little dull, however they explain a lot about the story and if you plan to watch, i'd suggest you listen to them carefully (Of course I was on my phone and looked up wiki pages to explain what I mist)

The overall series is brilliant. If you haven't watched it, i'd suggest you do, it's for everyone, no matter what you like, you'll be hooked on it. I myself a big lover of the whole dragon/sword fighting, my mother who is more into soaps, my girlfriend who loves the likes of Twlightlight and my brother who hates the whole sword/dragon type series all love it, no matter what you like you'll love GoT."
399,"The biggest TV series there has ever been, the biggest sets and casts there has ever been, The multiple characters, everything about Game of Thrones is big, and as the old saying goes ""the bigger they are.."" yeah you get it, but they're is no fall, so what happens when something big doesn't fall? well it's simple it stands tall and high above the rest? it gets recognized more often and it deserves it every bit of attention it gets, George RR Martin writes so many characters into the story it's unbelievable how he doesn't forget there names, there is such a vast range of character types, From Tyrion Lannister the Imp who we all love, to The Hound the bad guy who secretly we all love and isn't so bad and then there's characters like Bronn and Syrio Forrel, characters who are just simply so awesome, Credit also goes to D and D for bringing us 'A Song of Ice and Fire' also because if it wasn't for them many of us may never have heard it."
400,"As a kid I was fond of Age of Empires, Rome total war and many more strategy games. Have seen many films and series of kingdoms, kings and war. Including the great Indian Mythology 'Mahabharat', but none of them come miles closer to Games of Thrones. The art of kingship along with its struggle, blood and destiny has never been better portrayed. Games of Thrones takes you to a fictitious world in which you start believing and feel as if you are part it. Games of thrones is surely excellent for its cinematography,acting along with raw depiction of truth but its uncertainty and sudden change of events is what makes it the best. Waiting for next season."
401,"I have seen so many TV series, movies.. Game of Thrones is something magical, a true creation & making with extra ordinary story & script writing. Perfect & outrageous.

This is the top, the best TV series. Well done & best of luck for future, because we need such dedication for next 100 season's..

The detail's , that's what matter, how to handle all the character's & to continue story with their strong character's is very challenging.

Who will take the throne?. Ha ! who knows. My fav. character is "" Peter Dinclage "" As tyrion Lannister .

Again in the end , i have never written anything any where but it was worth it.

God Bless You All"
402,"Wow this really is an exceptional show. I wasn't sure if it was going to be able to live up to the hype but it far exceeded my expectations. My initial thoughts were that maybe people loved it because of all the sex scenes or maybe it was excessively violent, well it has both but it contributes to the storyline in a way that enforces the barbaric nature of a time long ago. Everything they have done feels calculated and necessary to tell the story properly.

Game of Thrones feels like a cross between Lord of the Rings and The Tudors. It is situated in a fantasy world and a historical period drama. The production quality feels like a big budget movie and they have assembled a team who seem to genuinely care about creating a quality show. Out of all the actors, Peter Dinklage is my favourite. He is great in his role and steals the scene from his other cast members. On the other end of the scale I hate the evil b!tch they call a queen and the snivelling prince sh!ts me off. Why does power always have to go to some people's heads. (I'm only 6 episodes in so my opinion could change)

At this point I am very happy with the direction of the show and look forward to many more seasons. I may even decide to read the books as I can't help but want more of Games of Thrones."
403,"All i really want to say about game of thrones is that i Love it! I really didn't think i would. I'm normally not in to the fantasy type stuff. When trees started walking in lord of the rings, i walked away from my TV! Its also safe to say i am now totally in love with Daenerys(Emelia Clarke)

Another thing i love about GoT is the emotions it seem to evoke! I found myself genuinely angry after season 3 episode 9 and had to take some time to calm down!! Why did i care so much!? The characters are amazing, you find yourself really rooting for certain people, and actually caring about others, and of course hoping others get what they deserved!

I normally like to save TV series up and watch them at my own pace, but with this i have to watch each episode as soon as its on TV! The only reason this doesn't get 10 stars from me is because i still can't fully get over the fantasy bits, fire gods, monsters north of the wall etc i clearly just don't have the imagination!"
404,"I started watching this about 2 years ago, because everyone told it was so good and interesting.

So in the first few episodes it seems like a total sci-fi. But it just keeps getting better with episode and then you're just can't wait to see the next episode.

I have seen all episodes and just finished the season 7. It is just amazing, it's the best and I think everyone should see it!

Every episode has so many details and the story through the seasons is quite complicated, but it's amazing that we have this show.

Superb quality and a MUST watch!"
405,Game of Thrones is really an excellent show. I have enjoyed it for many seasons. I love Emilia Clarke. I hope they don't stop making the show because she wants to leave. Maybe it will go on without her. The new season's first episode was excellent. I am hoping that it will continue this way. This production is so much better than the American TV shows. Better acting and story telling. This is the best TV show right now.
406,"Game of Thrones is the best TV series ever devised. There can be no competitors for its sheer scale, rich tapestry of characters, story, and wealth of talent on display.

Its almost an amusing slice of irony that a show of this scale, in all its enormous budget, sets, that the absolute best character and actor is the smallest of them all in the superb Peter Dinklage.

Some of the scenes may seem shocking in their graphic nature, indeed some may even seem gratuitous in their almost gleeful portrayal but this just lends to increasing the unerring fascination that series has generated in its fanbase.

The only drawback, if you could really call it that is the seeming penchant that the author George RR Martin has for killing off some of the best and most beloved characters before you really have a chance to explore what could happen with their development.

A sure sign of a excellent series with absolutely spot on casting is the ability to create characters that can genuinely stir up deep dislike, almost loathing in their total evil natures.

King Joffrey, portrayed by the excellent Jack Gleeson has generated such hatred that he has publicly stated his occasional run ins with fans who seem to struggle with detaching the character from the actor.

Following on from Joffrey are other equally despicable characters such as Cercei Lannister (Lena Headey) and Melisandre The Scarlet Witch (Carice Van Houten) that also deliciously bestow their characters with seemingly limitless cruelty and all round nastiness.

To counterbalance however have been such brilliant characters portrayed by established stars such as Sean Bean, Iain Glen, Charles Dance and Aiden Gillian.

To go through a thorough review of all the characters that are so incredibly portrayed would take far too long to cover with any kind of depth.

What has been an extremely smart move by the producers has been the casting of young and previously unknowns such as Kit Harrington and Maisie Williams who clearly have impressive careers ahead of them, almost solely due to Game of thrones being a springboard for their careers.

As is always the case there is a fear that Thrones may not last long enough, seemingly Hollywood has an unhealthy fetish for all good series to last no more than 7 seasons. This is one of those shows that could genuinely be a far longer running story that would continue to enthrall an enormous fan base that would only ever grow with each subsequent episode.

I am an extremely harsh reviewer and don't pull any punches when I feel a movie or TV show has ballsed up or not followed anything near to what the fans want or expect, however in this rare circumstance I cant find a single fault with this superb TV show. If you watch it in a Blu Ray boxset (I recommend you do, this show is worth investing in the tech to watch in good quality High Definition) then make sure you set aside a full weekend because once you start, you'll be hooked before you know it.

Seriously, Game Of Thrones is just that good."
407,"This is by far one of the best television shows out right now. Everybody has heard about Game of Thrones. It is quite possibly one of the most famous and well known TV shows out and everybody knows at least 1 person that watches it. I started watching when the show was on season 2 after a lot of my friends were talking about how great it was. I have not read the books. I'll be honest, the show is pretty tough to keep up with at first. If you haven't read the books, be prepared to do a bunch of recap readings because you will be confused in the first two or three episodes. There are a LOT of characters introduced, and becoming familiar with who everyone is and the relationships takes some getting used to. However, after the first three episodes, I was quite accustomed with who people were and how they were related to each other.

The plot is amazing. It is a very good complex in-depth story, and the pacing is fantastic. I am never bored during an episode. Especially considering that nobody is safe on this episode. Every character is disposable. There were important characters who I thought would never die that get killed off randomly. And these characters aren't just unimportant side characters. There have been a ton of main characters that have been killed off. It just makes the stakes that much higher and each episode is made so much more interesting because of that.

The acting is superb. Every actor does a great job. I especially love Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Maisie WIlliams and Kit Harington. Their performances are outstanding. However, every other performance is also fantastic. The actors clearly really care about their performances.

The effects are also marvelous. The big battles look epic and really nice especially for a television show. The white walkers and dragons also look really nice. The settings are also all beautifully crafted and look gorgeous.

This is not a show for the weak hearted. There is a ton of gruesome violence and a ton of graphic nudity. Many people say that Game of Thrones is basically a porno and it pretty much is. There is nudity in almost every episode whether it be topless girls or full frontal. GoT does not hold back. However, there are some absolute gorgeous ladies that have gotten nude on this show like Daenarys, Shae, Ygritte, Margaery, Melisandre, and many many more. For me, this is just icing on the cake of a very good show.

As my friend described it, this show has everything a guy could want from a TV show: an amazing story, tons of violence, tons of nudity and sex, dragons, magic, and zombies. It is an absolutely amazing show that really does deserve all the praise, and I simply cannot wait for season 5 to come out."
408,"Please note that I have not read the books. So this review is completely based on the TV show.

My my! What a show this is. It has a brilliant story, character development which is done very well (some movies / TV shows don't even care about this), and a whole lot of sex scenes and gore!

Yes,yes. I know. The first 4 episodes of the 1st season are boring as hell. It takes quite sometime in introducing all the characters, it confuses you as to who is what, but after a point of time it all gets fine. This show knows who must you hate, and who must you root for. It does this job perfectly. (Tyrion Lannister is my favourite. Peter Dinklage, you are an awesome actor!) There is the element of suspense, the action, the tension, the politics, the drama...so whats not to like about this?

Probably because of its slow start, loads of sex scenes, and confusing characters. I mean, come on. The sex scenes are unnecessary. I do agree with that. But whats to complain about it? When you have hot actresses like Emilia Clarke and Rose Leslie, why are you complaining? The books probably had them. So if they are staying true to the books, then what is wrong in that?

You will get used to the characters in due course. So be a little patient about that. All the characters are well-acted by some really good actors. It was good that they shot some scenes in the Dothraki or the Valyrian language instead of everything in English. It instills that feeling of that medieval age thing in you.

The main reason why i did not give this a full 10 was because of its very very slow start and that some parts of it that are still boring me. I really don't care about Stannis Baratheon or that Red Woman or the Greyjoys. Which is a bummer, coz if they start focusing more on someone who you don't like much, then you might probably start skipping their parts. You start to feel as if their parts could have been fast forwarded in terms of their storyline. One good example i can think of is the White Walkers. i don't hate them in terms of their character, but they have not done much damage at all other than the opening scene in Season 1 Episode 1. I want to see them to do more damage to someone at least. They take so much time to cross the wall itself!!

Overall, this is a great show with a few flaws. And just because i gave it a 8 does not mean i don't like it. I love it. If you can imagine, I sat 4 hours a day watching 4 episodes each day and finished watching 4 seasons in just 2 weeks! Its that interesting sometimes.

So do not Google it, or even YouTube about this show. Coz there are idiots over there who have put so many spoilers here and there. So just go to some torrent website, download this and have fun.!

I've tried my best to give a spoiler-free review. Thanks for Reading."
409,"I mainly watch GOT because I like Peter Dinklage - he's clearly brilliant. The show is very well-produced but it does drag. I always multi-task while watching because the plot is repetitive. There are also numerous two-dimensional characters where you just chuckle when they get decapitated or hump each other or whatever. A lot of the actors carry flat, wooden faces throughout their entire on screen existence (including the girl with the dragons). Having posted that, the dragons are indeed cool. So I guess I'm just another fantasy nerd like everyone else who watches this show. Game of Thrones is not 100% compelling and it's hard to believe anyone would watch an episode more than once, unless for clarification"
410,"I've never anticipated that one day I will watch series like game of thrones. It's more than amazing, eventually I've noting to say here I just highly recommend it. Yes one thing I feel bad that season 3 will take so long to be in air. I did not get the idea for 10 lines, but finally I made it. Noting hard these days. Copy and paste ^ I've never anticipated that one day I will watch series like game of thrones. It's more than amazing, eventually I've noting to say here I just highly recommend it. Yes one thing I feel bad that season 3 will take so long to be in air. I did not get the idea for 10 lines, but finally I made it. Noting hard these days."
411,"First, a disclaimer.....

1. I have not read any of the books this series is based on, nor was I aware of the author until the release of this series.

2. I was NOT attracted to this series until almost the end of the second season.

Why? Simply because the genre is usually not done well on T.V.. USUALLY it's pretty cheesy, campy, with a low budget, and terrible writing.

That about covers it, now for the rest.

DESPITE having absolutely NO desire to watch this show, I opted to give it a try due to the overwhelming number of my acquaintances who claimed the show was worth a watch.

They were right. I was wrong. TERRIBLY wrong.

The production values are excellent, the acting is excellent, and the story is well written, intriguing, and has a universal appeal that practically anyone can appreciate and relate to on a personal level.

I would highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates a well produced, acted, and compelling story, as this series is one of THE best, if not THE best, series ever put out on TV, or film alike.

10 of 10 stars."
412,"The first series EVER to deserve more then 10 starts, a MUST watch.

If you think ANY other is the best series ever thats because you missed this one.

My top 3:

1st: Game of Thrones - It has no week points, great scenarios and excellent acting... xxx 2nd: Breaking Bad - The first episode says it all... xxx 3rd: Swingtown - Magnificent series, too bad ratings dictated the fate of this gem.

If you have doubts... Just Watch 2 episodes and you'l see...

Have fun"
413,"I read Game of Thrones back in 2000 it was amazing i made all my friends run out and get it as well. I just recently got the chance to see game of thrones threw HBO go and it brought back all my fond memories with ten times the amount i couldn't have even envisioned in my own head. Its true to the book and the visuals are breathtaking.

Sean bean just happens to be one of my favorite actors of all time but honestly all the acting is so good i cant believe how good it is. Even though i love Seans skills i have to give it up to Kit Harington as he pulls off Snow so brilliantly, although i shouldn't say that because there has been not one person within all episodes that has not done a top notch job. The music is fantastic and the sound effects divine, except on one occasion one the first episode where it showed horses being rode in the snow, the sound effect was that of horses walking on a road rather than a forest with snow (should of been soft followed by crunches fellas lol) anyway this show is an easy 11 out of 10.

I hope this series goes on forever. Game of Thrones was the only reason i picked up HBO and if it stays on HBO, HBO will forever be purchased in this household."
414,"After watching the Spartacus : Gods of the Arena series I saw this was advertised. Immediately attracted to the scene of Sean Bean (Eddard Stark) wielding a huge clay-more I knew I had to watch it. At first I called it ""The Lord of the Rings, but different"" only because of Ned Stark's striking resemblance to Sean Bean's other famous role Boromir. However after a mere few minutes into watching the series I realised this was in it's entirely different world.

As the characters progressed and loved and hated each other each episode I was even more drawn in. Upon watching the series a second time I loved it only more.

The saga leaves us with an epic cliffhanger in the series' penultimate episode and in the final episode, which I will obviously not disclose here but, it left me in awe and I could not wait for the next episode/season. When the series finished I could not wait for the next season so began watching again, as well as purchasing all the books.

I have never been so in love with something I have so many hates for. I do not consider these flaws but only interesting and new writing styles. It makes it more realistic the way you are screaming at the screen going ""WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!"" and etc. Hating and loving some characters and plot devices is exactly what the writers wanted me to do.

This is one of the best television series I have ever seen. Probably the best. If I were a producer I would be throwing my money at this to make more and more. I would even pay off George Martin to write more books just so I am entertained for the next 40 years.

This combines love, hate, gore, sex, evil, good, and adventure perfectly into a fine mix which should be savoured. Truly I hope I haven't bigged it up to much. However it is incredible"
415,"An amazingly strong cast of Britains best actors and actresses work alongside some of their quality Stateside fellows. A strong script taken from a well loved series of books, weaves and creates a place populated by real people where the cut and thrust of normal life plays alongside the Epic nature of the Royal and Knightly families. Scenery, wardrobe, CGI, etc all maintain the highest of HBO's standard.

I am sure there are some, aka the ""Twighlight"" type audience, who will find this story too complex, too ""wordy"" and too epic to grasp. But those of us who loved HBO's ""ROME"" and the screen epic ""LOTR"", watch this series with wonder and a big smile on our faces.......Raymond E Feist's ""Magician"" next please.

All at HBO take a bloody well deserved bow......."
416,"I am completely blown away by this series. After spending my fourth of July finishing all ten episodes (No, I am not a recluse, I was just so hooked that I found nothing else worthwhile of my time), and finding out that the next season won't be released for another year, I've been obsessively looking at posts on the discussion board in hopes of putting my impatience and restlessness at ease. Seeing as that was unproductive use of my time, I decided to write this review instead so that I could at least get some final thoughts off my chest and hopefully get some sleep afterward. The beginning of episode one was a little slow, as they are with all TV series- they need to introduce characters and set the framework for the entire show, rest assured it picks up quickly. A lot of people seem to have a basis of comparison for this show, having been avid readers of the books by GRRM. For the large majority of readers, they haven't been disappointed with this adaptation. To those of you who haven't read the books, coming from a non-reader herself, the show will have the same brilliant effect. Yes, there are a lot of characters, but after episode 1, you slowly get the hang of it, and each episode leaves you craving for more. The acting is superb and incredibly believable, even the minor characters play their part exceptionally well. HBO has never disappointed me with their quality productions, and Game of Thrones is yet another masterpiece. My only hope is that it doesn't meet the same fate as Rome and Deadwood, because, boy would that be a shame."
417,"This must be a special series, as I have never submitted a post before in my life! And I came a little late to the ""Game,"" having watched the first and second episodes back-to-back in the second week of the season. I was so blown away by the production quality and potential of the story line that I went straight to the store and purchased all 4 of the books. Talk about exceptional...I finished all 4 books in 2 1/2 weeks! HBO has me hooked and George R.R. Martin is my new hero. I just hope that HBO doesn't stop the series before it gets to the end of what's already written. Here's to my new favorite show and book series...can't wait for Dance with Dragons!"
418,I've watched three seasons this weekend back to back. I've tried three times and this is the furthest I've got. I'll watch until the end because I can't really have a final say until I've seen it all. It drags on a bit and not quite sure what all the massive fuss is about really. Seen better shows / films.
419,"I wish I could rate different parts of this show separately,because if I were to give the first few seasons of the show a rating it would be nothing less than a 10/10. Honestly the first four seasons of this show are still my favourite seasons of television ever made,but after season 4 this show goes too far downhill for me to give this a positive rating. If had to rank all the seasons it would go 3,1,2,4,then twenty lairs of crap then 5, and then fifty more lairs of crap then 6,7. If you want my advice, watch the first three or four seasons and then pretend like it got cancelled and just read the books."
420,"Dragon flew to the rescue too Quickly, Jon Snow and Daenerys sex/love happened too Quickly, Everything in the show goes too Quickly! What, they have no Money to continue GOT in a usual speed? Or actors are Tired? Or rating fell?"
421,"So i'm writing my first review just because people here at IMDb(not only here) cant review without prejudice. 1=awful 10=excellent based on this...please ignore all 1 ratings or garbage ratings ,these people are immature people who just hate movie/show based on their own expectations coming out from their personal experience.

If 5 is average then i would say this show, just for effects,realism,camera,music score! etc...deserves at least 5. All above is really above average. I didn't liked the hype either form the start and i started watching in 2013 i think...first two episodes from series one wasn't enough, there was just too much confusion and it was hard for me to concentrate/orient in everything going on the screen. Third(S01E03) was like a bait for fish. It completely hooked me up and just had to watch the rest. After i watched first two seasons ...i couldn't wait any longer and i bought the books. ...rest is not important.

Anyway there are some flaws and cliché i think, but as a whole pack this show is on top along with Breaking bad."
422,"Well then. Game of Thrones is one of the very few movies/shows I can stand. I despise cliché story lines, bad acting, predictability, Game of Thrones has none of these letdowns.

A Brilliant story, constantly playing with your emotions, head and heart. The impossible becomes possible, a world where anything and everything happens.

Amazing, detailed cast, Incredible portrayal of the monsters that lie, sleeping, inside all of us.

There is no 9.5/10, so I will stick with a 9. There is almost nothing wrong with Game of Thrones, one or two things that could be better, but overall, the single best show I have ever watched.

If you want to be taken on a wild ride, through magical lands full of wolves, lions, dragons, stags and golden roses with extremely sharp thorns, Game of Thrones is definitely the one to watch!"
423,"This show is one in a million. The difference between Game Of Thrones and other shows is simply this. Every episode is grabbing, i found that in Breaking Bad, or in Sons Of Anarchy, or in True Detective that the episodes are not reeling you in every time. But in this masterpiece, i find that i am always interested to watch. One aspect of brilliance includes the dispersion of the various character story lines. E.g. Daenerys Targarean, or Jamie Lannister, or Arya Stark etc. This technique enhances the viewers attention, and gives the audience something new to look forward to, rather than three or four characters that are followed the whole episode (like other TV shows). Overall, this is my favourite show, and is excellent. No other show competes with GOT, Winter Is Coming!!!"
424,"It took me a couple of episodes to start liking Game of Thrones. Probable reason is that i expected ""Tolkien for adults"". Well, there's definitely a lot of adults' stuff here, although closer to reality of Middle Ages, if this might apply to a fantasy novel about an imaginary world turned TV show. Since i haven't read the book(s), i was free to enjoy the show as it is.

At certain points Game of Thrones might have passed for a historical reenactment. Magic and other fantasy elements were introduced at a slow pace which adds to the realism mentioned above. The production and sets were impressive and the cast delivered and exquisite performance.

Overall, Game of Thrones was television's logical answer to Lord of the Rings. Together with the latter title it has set the bar for fantasy films and TV shows very high. I would even say that they've spoiled the audiences. Any new venture in the genre will have to fulfill very high expectations.

EDIT after Season 5

My enthusiasm waned although the appreciation remains. My recap would be: Good Season 1, solid Season 2, rather eventless Season 3 and somewhat redeeming season 4. Season 5 was an obvious management decision in an attempt to create the most massive cliffhanger finale in the history of TV. There is one for every story line in the show.

What became apparent already in Season 3 is what some fans complained about when discussing G.R.R. Martin's writing. There is a clear lack of direction, what some might label narrative fiction. During Season 5 we've reached the end of plots in the books published so far. This, in turn, enabled the writers to write as they well pleased and stretch the audience's attention span until the end of Season 7."
425,"It just doesn't get better than this.

Acting: check .. Cinematography: check .. Dialogue: check .. Directing/Screening: check

If you are not a fan of Fantasy i urge you to watch this show as it will completely change your perception. This show is so true to the book its unreal at how they managed to capture each and every essence that the book emits. It takes a couple of episodes for one to be totally engrossed into it. I have a 6-episode rule with all shows however this show needed no more than 20 mins for you to know that it was going to be exceptionally good"
426,"As a movie and a TV series freak i was doubting for a while that HBO maybe took a big bite whit this series,but luckily that wasn't the case.

HBO did a great job whit this one and i am sure that it will stay like that.I am a little puzzled by the fact that no one tried to make a movie rather then a TV series like whit ""The lord of the rings"" saga.

Best TV series i watched so far ( and i watched a lot ),i am really thankful to HBO for putting in the extra effort to not go away from the storyline and production/wise it was more then i expected.

Pure 10 in my opinion

Regards Ognjen Kisic"
427,"I have to say that from Seasons 1-4 -- which is as far as I've been able to watch because I have a life -- the series is SO BAD that you almost can't stop watching... because how much worse can it actually get?

The whole series is like a clip of Xanadu placed in Dante's Inferno. Without giving anything away, the sheer number of characters creates enough chaos to turn the viewer off. You start to think, ""Surely at some point things will level off,"" but the number of spoiled and whining rich kids is just overwhelming.

A few of them die off (THANK GOODNESS), but it's just not enough to make the series appealing. There are too many diversions from the books -- yes, read the books and don't go by this ridiculous adaptation.

I've never rated anything a 1 out of 10 in my life. I really thing that there's a silver lining in everything, but this... I don't know, guys. It's time to cut your losses.

Of course the show is INSANELY POPULAR in the States... but look who they put on THEIR ""throne.""

Ugh."
428,Realistically this show is 7-8 but i just can\t believe the average score is 9.5!!!! No way this fricking fantasy show averages between 9 and 10 over 1M people!!!!!!
429,"Every time I get free HBO I give this show a try, and every time it never fails to confuse and bore me, and I turn it off ten minutes in. How does a viewer of this garbage keep track of the families and their members without a score card? What is with the zombie skeletons and the dragons? If I wanted to watch a ""Dark Ages"" type of show, I watch ""Vikings"", ""The Last Kingdom"" or ""The Bastard Executioner""- at least those shows are easy to keep up with and have history as a reference point, and no dragons and zombies as distractions. How ""Game of Thrones"" won so many awards and is now ingrained in popular culture is beyond me and demonstrates the shallowness of the producers/writers of this crap and the low expectations the viewing public has for television entertainment."
430,"I've seen all episodes so far, and I've finally made up my mind about this show.

It's been a bit back and forth for me - and there have been times when I've greatly enjoyed it, which is why I can't be too harsh.

I've read about half of the first book, just because I wanted to see how different it was - and it seems to me the show is quite loyal to the book in the important ways.

Now, I can see the appeal of this show - but I must say I disagree with the universal praise. It's obviously supposed to be a plausible reflection of medieval Europe with some fantasy trappings - but I don't see how it succeeds.

My primary issue is extremity. Every character seems to be an extreme of one sort or another. I'm not saying they don't have nuances or that they're not ""grey"" - because they are, and that's fine. But their acts and their profile are basically extreme. This goes for ALL the primary characters - and almost all of the secondary characters.

We have the most altruistic honorable people and we have the most excessively cruel sociopaths. They may have nuance and grey areas - but they're delivered through extremities.

It's like the writer or the producers want to make an impression every few minutes. Every time we establish a warrior as the greatest of all time - and we get some excessive act described or demonstrated, another warrior comes along that's just that little bit more extreme. Constantly. How many ""best"" and ""most fierce"" warriors do we have again? Bronn, Nedd, Kingslayer, Rob, Robert, Bear, Hound - and on and on and on. They're all superheroes, basically. They all have a well told tale of some superhuman act in the past that hammers into the head of the audience just how bad ass they really are. It's cool the first time - but not the 20th time. It loses its effect and you get diminishing returns.

This goes for all the profile types, including the power-hungry lords and ladies and the schemers. Each more extreme than the last. It goes for the ""evil"" people as well.

Every time we have a person behave in the most cruel way imaginable - we have another enter the scene and demonstrate why the last satanic individual was almost kind in comparison. Lest the viewer/reader forgets how very harsh this world is.

It's layer upon layer of extremities. It's as if the world has no subtlety and the characters are incapable of not trying their hardest to get noticed at every turn.

To me, that's desperation. It's the desire to bring shock and awe over the desire to write or show real people with real issues. Sure, the conditions are brutal - and people would naturally have to do a lot of questionable or brave things to survive - but not with every beat of their heart.

If you want the greatest impact, what you do is that you pace your big scenes. You hold back and you build tension. You don't have to torture people visibly every other episode. One time is enough - and you don't have to make every character an extreme. Some people have a harmony about them - and they can make a strong impression over time.

All those ""cool"" scenes of torture, violence, sex and so on would be so much more profound if they didn't happen constantly.

I understand the temptation of a writer who's trying to match a true great like Tolkien. Tolkien was very different - and his was a very romantic and mythological approach. But he understood subtlety and he didn't bring too much attention to his characters at every turn. No, he built tension slowly - and the effect was that much more powerful.

That's something Martin could learn from. Yes, yes - the world is harsh and people suffer all the time. But even in the harshest of worlds, we will have the mundane and we will have average people failing or succeeding without going above or below average.

Subtlety did exist in medieval Europe - I'm almost sure of it."
431,"Games of Thrones,

Well it is a series that has excellent:

1. Photography 2. Soundtrack 3. Astonishing women and men as actors 4. Great costumes and many more things

But... Does someone agree that the story hasn't gone nowhere after 11 episodes? It is very slow and in each episode there hardly happens something and we are getting to any certain point. I hope this will change very soon because if not it will be a big fluke. The same thing happened with the second series of Boardwalk empire and i presume HBO is trying to make a lot of money with long stretched series abandoning there usual quality and amazing productions.

Because the story lines are weak i only give it a 7.5/10"
432,"One of the most overrated TV shows. But hats off to creaters, nudity did bring audience and today's youth, well u got them. But why so much nudity just to gain audience. Good scripts automatically attracts TRP. PLEASE END THIS SHOW AND SPARE OUR YOUTHS.Have watched better shows and loved them but not this one"
433,"I couldn't disagree more with all the glowing reviews of this series.

as a fan of the literary series, i wasn't optimistic about a conversion to film. the story is just too deep. there are too many characters with nuanced attributes. i never believed it could translate to film. i was right.

have you ever read a ""cliff notes"" version of a classic novel? sure, it helped you get an ""A"" on your 8th grade book report, but it didn't help you appreciate the source material. that's what this series is, the Cliff Notes version of the war for Westeros.

Bottom line: there is no way to distill 800 pages of excellent story-telling, character development and world-lore into twelve hours of film and do it any sort of justice. this is exactly what HBO is attempting to do with Game of Thrones. Fail. The series is an empty husk attempting to replicate the brilliance of the novels. It just doesn't translate.

What are we left with? An apparent money grab by G.R.R. Martin and the starched shirts at HBO (who are trying to pimp mediocrity in the form of Boardwalk Empire to fill the abscess left by The Sopranos).

Weak effort. You should have just left it alone, George. Concentrate on finishing the series. Please don't pull a Robert Jordan-act on us."
434,Books were great while they lasted. Show was great while it followed original story. Starting from episode 6 season 7 it lost everything what made this story/show great.
435,"The true miracle of this series is how the producers created a somewhat coherent viewing experience giving the paltry, prolix ridden, source material. Of course the main story arc suffers from the same problem the majority of modern serialized productions suffer from, in that the massively stretched arc is inherently flaccid, obvious and completely dependent on obscurity and plot twists to remain somewhat a recognizable plot.

Luckily, unlike the books that read like a poor mans Tolkien (If Tolkien was a semi-literate screenwriting, plagiarizing historical narratives and putting dragons in them), the character development in the show is pretty solid and enjoyable up until they get killed off of course.

So regardless of the coming inevitable unsatisfying and underwhelming ending of the main story arc, as a collection of character arcs, GoT is certainly interesting mindless escapism."
436,"This got to be the greatest tv series ever !!! and I can't see anyone match this !!!

Simple awesome and phenomenal"
437,"I love game of thrones At the beginning I wasn't used to see this violence and nudity, however game of thrones changed my view. I've watched season 1-4 in 3 days , season 5 and half of season 6 in 1 days and season 6 and 7 from 11pm until 12pm the next days 🙈I've watched all the seasons Currently reading the novels I've watched every YouTube video about it I'm following all the characters and actors and all the fan pages Both on Facebook and Instagram Simply it's game of thrones waiting on fire for season 8 I'm in love with John snow He's my dream"
438,The title says it all. This show is in a group all it's own.
439,"Game of Thrones has been out for a couple of years and I've never wanted to watch it as i thought that people overrate it. I recently decided to watch a couple of episodes to give it a chance and by curiosity over the show everyone talks about.I was mistaken, this show is magnificent, i started and i cant stop, it is way too good and it deserve all the praise it gets , its by far the best show ive ever seen and Im happy i gave it a shot, if you are wondering if u should watch, do it you will not regret a single moment watching this."
440,"I'll try to keep it short and sweet. As a reader of the books and a huge fan of them, the show has not let me down. Superb acting all around. They did wonderful with almost every acting choice. It made me forget how i even pictured most of the characters before the show. That's when you know you have a solid adaptation. The good guys get it rough and the show stays true to the book's savagery that no one is safe.

The show should only be for adults or mature audiences. It doesn't hold back on nudity, rape, murder, lies, deceit, and torture. That's one of the things that makes the show so good because the books didn't either and it's important to keep true to the source content. This is a fantasy lover's dream with midevil elements everywhere from wars with sword and shields and bows to dragons to magic. But it seems to appeal to everyone. People I didn't even think would like this show are becoming fans. Why? Because the characters are so good and well written. Throw that in with amazing settings, great plots, beautiful and fitting music, and just all around creative writing.

I wanted to address a few concerns that I see in most negative reviews. 1. Nudity and obscenity : This show gets a lot of negative reviews for nudity, gore, and obscene scenes. But I don't understand that. Don't knock a show because you can't handle it. The books weren't quite as bad but they were still unforgiving and unrelenting in the same manner. The show obviously isn't for everyone, but i wish those people just didn't watch it instead of giving shallow, bias, and uneducated reviews for which half the time they don't really know what they're talking about. 2. Straying from the source content. (Books) The rest of the negative reviews usually pertain to the show straying away from the books on some details for little to no reasons. The truth is that the books are so vast, the show has to omit some character and change a few plot happenings, twists, and outcomes to stay within time constraints for budget reasons. The show has the highest budget to date for a TV show, even with the changed details. I was bummed about a few characters not being there and a few changes that happened to some that were. But I understood there was no way they could fit everything from the book. But hell, the show even improved on a lot of characters that were a but underwhelming in the book.

GoT will go down as one of the best shows ever. Appreciate it for what it is and don't just look for unfair reasons not to like it. It's a great adaptation but also stands alone as David and D.B.'s (the writers) own take on A Song of Ice and Fire."
441,I have never seen a show quite like this. It's like your watching it for REAL!
442,"Surprized that my search for a good movie ended here!

I will talk about this series until my last breath!"
443,"This is one series that has only ever grown better with each season that has passed.

It's beautiful, it's brutal at times and it's white-knuckle exciting!

I cannot wait for the next season, although knowing it will be the final of the series makes it heartbreaking also."
444,10/10 no question from start all the way to season 7. Riveting fantasy that feels feels. The acting is of another world and the directing is a master piece. Enjoy the ride.
445,"My initial rating was a solid 10, but while watching seasons 5-7 I was tempted to lower my rating even more.

I was a fan of the show, before I was a fan of the books, but I fell in love with the beautiful writing of George RR Martin. Even in a world of dragons and blood magic, there is realism that can be found in the story. There are no ""bigger than life"" characters, but instead flawed human beings that you can actually empathy with.

This is why, when I was seeing all the opportunities the show runners missed or choose to miss and some of Martin's cleverly crafted storylines turned to failures (see Dorne, the Greyjoys and even Daenerys character development at times) I was disappointed to say the least.

Non the less Game of Thrones is an excellent show. The cinematography, special effects and direction are breathtaking at times (see Battle of the Bastards episode) as a lot of people have pointed out before me.

I understand the difficulty of transferring Martin's immense fictional world to screen and at this point I have chosen to separate the show from the books (as the show runners clearly intend) and regard them as two totally different things.

If anyone misses the suspense of earlier seasons, I recommend reading the books. They are about 1000 pages each, but we all have to wait until 2019 anyway and winter is coming."
446,Honestly I can't ask for more...but this is the BEST FANTASTIC show I had ever been watching...and I definitely interested to watch the show all over again and when I watch this I get hooked up with DRAGONS!!! I won't get tired of this but this show everyone in the family room felt so real of believing that what would happen if this fantasy take place in real LIFE!!!??
447,"One of the best TV series I have ever seen in my whole life. Actors work perfectly,plot in each season is better. Waiting for new season."
448,"Game of thrones created by George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels. The novel itself was the best seller and loved by everyone. George R. R. Martin did not stop by just the book. A TV show has started in 2011 by HBO. television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. The Game of Thrones was hit the rating from the first season the show is been growing more and more as the season is building. The massive adventure,cool action and awesome character build. Game of thrones is now the most viewed and most popular show ever."
449,"After watching the first season I have not been able to emotionally connect with a single line or character. It seems that the dwarf is the most sympathetic figure, every one else being either weak or false or dead by the end of the season. The plot is chaotic. Amount of violence is on par with Spartacus: Blood And Sand. Nudity is corruptive and mostly unjustified. Power is the name of the game. Sean Bean is probably the best actor in the series. Yet, this is far off his performance in LOR. The only thing I could connect with were beautiful landscapes of Malta where some scenes were shot. I would rather recommend Rome series, which has a superior plot line and character build."
450,"Repetitive, boring, more appearance than content (like most of HBO's hits, it's more a video clip than something with sense), extraordinarily overrated. Booooooooring"
451,"Have to say that shortly after the start of season five I have become weary of so much sadistic violence over and over again and not anything good ever happening. The story line keeps dragging on and on with seemingly only new angles on just what different and graphic forms of killing and mutilation can be devised and delivered with optimum special effects. It is a game of thrones and a game where not only nobody wins but just how badly everyone loses, one at a time, told in layered story groupings, episode after episode. Enough already. Apparently this is what keeps the series ratings high and I just no longer want to be a part of this feed so goodbye Game of Thrones."
452,"Sadly, I already finished the books, so my expectations were bigger. The books are great and anyone who wants to feel the real thrill of the series should read those.

Overall the series are OK, but ""haste"" is the overwhelming feeling, like everything was done in a hurry, some of the actors seem to be paid for words per minute, rather than performance.

The plots, intrigues, betrayals are described in an excellent manner in the books, but the series keep a rather thin line of those, concentrating more on sex, violence and non-important eye-catching aspects. They missed many important things from books in my opinion, things that would have lead to a better understanding of main plot and of some characters.

On top of these, HBO Romania managed to make 31 translation errors in 2 episodes, 10 of them being severe. ""Calapono"" instead of ""Khal Pono"" for example. Too many for any television that has any respect for it's viewers. The one that translated never touched the books.

10 episodes per book are too few to capture the magic described by Martin. I strongly recommend the books."
453,"This is our contemporary situation in a nutshell. People are meat that entertain you or they are worth nothing. See a woman degrading herself for you? Great. Just grab it.

I've always thought soccer was the most eloquent statement about the current odious state of the human condition, but this show might just have it beat. Again, though, like many Tarantino movies, this could be an useful screening device for new dates. Anyone that likes this is dead behind the eyes and sees you totally in terms of an object that can do things to satisfy them.

Purest narcissistic solipsism."
454,"Can't see why this is so popular and gets such a high score on IMDb! At rare instances it is fairly enjoyable but most of the time it moves forward in such a slow pace that you will ask yourself over and over again; why are people so crazy about this show? Disturbs me that it has a rating close to Breaking Bad, which has rightfully earned a high score (I give it 10/10). I wonder if it is the teenagers enjoying the quite frequent display of tits and ass?

It's a high budget production which shows and most of the actors do a decent job even though I find Peter Dinklage to weak an actor to have such a high profile on the show.

Game of thrones is a sleeping pill and the occasional exciting moments are not worth it.

Now that I have started watching it I can't stop, sleeping pill or not, I still want to know how it ends."
455,"The greatest show I have ever seen. I watched it as it was coming out episode by episode but wasn't able to watch season 6. Before the premiere of season 8, I went thru and rewatched the show in its entirety. Some times as many as a whole season in a day. The show has all the elements that make for a great show. Humor, devastating sadness, edge of your seat excitement and a great, gripping storyline. I laughed, I cried thug tears, I stood up and clapped and I sat back and grinned with pride. I grew to love (almost) all the characters in one way or another. Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington and Emilia Clark were amazing and played their roles to perfection. There will never be another show like Game Of Thrones. I wish I had more hands so I can give this show 4 thumbs up. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes TV. You don't have to be someone who likes fantasy, I'm not."
456,"This review, hopefully adding a unique insight, is about slipping quality of Game of Thrones, from the flawless 1st to 4th seasons. To the excellent 5th-6th, where source material was thinning and signs were showing of uncertainty. To the 7th and 8th seasons, where there has been an obvious drop in the quality of the show.

Essentially the prime, and mostly obvious reason for the fall of this show is that the creators have been forced to deviate away from the source material, due to that fact that there wasn't anymore. The quality that has taken Martin years to painstakingly forge, now has to be created by a team of Hollywood heads who have had formulas pumped into their brains as to how to write an engaging show. In their defense, the show runners are trying to create a standard of writing in the space of a year that is not possible.

But the primary problem not that, it is that these producers of the show have set and ending schedule. They have had to write out a way that this show will end. This means that plot points will have to be carefully mapped out and that character behaviour and motive will have to align with how the producers plan to end the show. This is the biggest mistake they have made. On the other hand George R. R. Martin has constantly driven the story through the character's behaviour and motive. The characters were so real and so believable and so deep because they were not locked into a narrative. The story was so engaging, because, like the people driving it, it was unpredictable. People are so complex, we never know how they are going to react or behave. We look at all of the pressures and circumstances that Martins characters were under, and we see why they made the decisions that they made. The story was shaped this way. It had a beautiful organic nature about it. Once Martin's source material was exhausted, the writers not only had to substitute their own limited imaginations over that of a genius, but they had to do it in a very short time. More importantly they made the mistake of wedging characters into plot points. Character motives and actions now secondary. Their depth, and potential influence on the story now brushed away with insincere dialogue and actions in order to fit their long establish role into the the plot box that has now been predetermined for them. That is where the wheels came off this masterpiece, sadly. Simply, put, the plot was put before the characters. The rushed finale of the show was unavoidable given that the books weren't finished and actors age. On a positive note, the show on it's own merit is still good, I still like it, albeit with an ever present disappointment in what could have been. The sets and costumes are as magnificent as ever. But if I'm right the potential for a quality GOT prequel is very high, there is hope!"
457,"I admit I am a late bloomer to watching GoT. I have always wanted to, but living in a different country for the first few years after it premiered prevented me from seeing it. I just started it in January of this year and wow, I never realized how much I was truly missing. This show is incredible. The acting, storylines, shock value... I don't think any other show can ever live up to Got's overall strengths. It can be hard to keep track of the characters but once you get a few episodes in you're hooked. Yes, I'm not going to be in denial, some episodes were boring, but that doesn't detract from the majority of the amazing episodes. I feel bad for people who had to wait a year in between (and 2 years from the last) between seasons. I felt spoiled being able to binge watch the show in about a month. If you're one of those ""I can't start now because I'm so behind"" people, don't be! I promise you will love it and I'm hindsight you will be like how did I ever survive. Literally the best show ever."
458,"Best TV show in the world ever. When it ends, I am going to cry. No joke."
459,The best show ever undoubtedly and will be looked upon by generations to come
460,This show just get better and better. I'm glad that I'm alive to watch this show.
461,"I tried to watch GOT a Few years back and made it through about 20 minutes before I changed the channel, disgusted by an overhyped series that garnered more attention than any other show before it. I admit, I was apprehensive before I even started it and my perception was that it sucked so it truly didn't stand a chance. Fast forward to spring of 2018, my friend was watching the first episode, right about where I had turned it off, and I expressed my aforementioned opinion of it to him. He implored me to give it another try. So I did, with an open mind, and a better attitude, GOT quickly became not only a GREAT show, but it was inciting extreme interest like no other series I had ever experienced. So began the binging, and it didn't stop until I was out of new content. This show has a unique way of presenting characters that at first, you can't stand, but come to love and cheer for as the story unfolds. In fact, the characters I disliked the most, typically became my favorites and that was a clever and deliberate dynamic that keeps on coming and is only the beginning of so many in this formula. The writing and story arcs are absolutely some of the finest I've ever experienced and again, the character development is in a class of its own. The biggest and possibly only blaring issue I have with GOT is that it's coming to an end, but that's also what makes this show such a treasure to so many people. I've never really ""bought in"" to the high fantasy genre over the years. In fact, it was always probably my least favorite of them all. I hope this review can inspire more viewers like me, who have either been closed minded due to the hype surrounding it, or some other reason to give this masterpiece a chance to win them over. GAME OF THRONES is my absolute favorite series EVER and I can't express enough just how unique and original it is. Through this experience, I've come to understand as it relates to GOT, there are two types of people in this world: those who LOVE it, and those who haven't seen it yet. Winter is coming....."
462,"Ok , so I stumbled upon ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" after reading the first Dunk & Egg novella in the graphic novel adaptation. Since reading the first book, I thought Martin had just redefined sooooo many standards in Fantasy literature but, at the end of the day , had written an incredibly complex and masterful story, period

Then news started to come out about TV adaptation - that was really, REALLY frightening. The complexitiy , the subtelty, the richness, the vastness of Martin's work was so hard to handle that I was fearing for the worst.

I mean, how can you possibly transport Tyrion form page to screen without loosing the characther soul, spirit , wit and depht? That's the kind of things I was worried about.

So episode 1 was finally on the air, and when I sat and started to watch it I was prepared for the worst.

But them I saw the Men of the Black Watch getting trough the tunnel. No words spoken, no sounds but the horses' hoofs softly clopping the snow-covered soil. I just needed to see THAT first sequence to relax and dismiss all my fears. I said to my self : ""the lads REALLY know what they're doing"". I watched the rest of episode 1 with half a smile on my lips, every charachter/actor choiche was incredible, and the small details diverting from the books - like Sean Bean dirty blonde hair vs. Ned's black ones - were completely overriden by the actors' performances. And of course after witnessing Dinklage doing his things the imagine of Tyrion I had in my mind was definitely transformed into a new, Dinklage-ish version

Having said that, I still think the Dorne plot was miserable -even if Pedro was in-fu*§ing-credible as the Red Viper - so there are still thing in this show that can be put down to an human level......but overall this is still the closest thing to perfection one can imagine"
463,Looking forward for closing.. and more unexpectedness and charm
464,"I finally caught up with everyone to see the legendary Game of Thrones myself. I'm intrigued to see how the story folds in the final season in the following spring.

I watched this series without the actual hype train, which I believe to be a good thing. Game of Thrones is a strong player in the genre of fantasy and mystical creatures. It has some strong characters and interesting, complicated plot lines.

However from the very beginning of the show I had a hard time finding my favorite characters. I don't know if it's because of the ruthlessness of the era or just the fact that the milieu is so far from my own reality - I couldn't find anyone to like. The characters are mean, hyper sexual and somewhat blank. Although the acting work in Game of Thrones is amazing, I feel some of the characters fall kinda flat - but that's for the writing to blame in my opinion. Also due to the short lifespan of the characters I found it hard to get actually attached to anyone.

Some of the episodes are too slow for my taste and there are a couple of scenes that are made with unnecessary gore.

Game of Thrones is a strong drama with a unique and intriguing plot. It has its flaws and you might benefit watching it with someone who already knows what's going on (ie. has read the books or watched the series at least once). The relations of the characters are a total chaos and you'll probably struggle with memorizing the places and families for the first two seasons... let alone adding up all the magic and creatures to this whole mess.

Game of Thrones is something I'd watch once. I won't go back to it, but I recommend it with a hand to my heart. (And don't worry, even I found my own favourites after season 7)"
465,"Can't wait for Season 8! The Night king is really mysterious which kind of bums me out cause his intentions are unknown. Otherwise love the CGI for the Dragons, White Walkers etc. Battle sequences are breath taking."
466,The cast is superb. This will open fan eyes to a new dimension. Organised as a religion. You will never see an intriguing TV series like this even in next decade.
467,Getting in to the world of game of thrones is very easy and you will get lost in it re watching never gets old
468,Usually i don't watch fantasy movies and TV series .But this Amazing work is an Exeption . Damn !! I enjoyed every minute of this Piece of Art .and i'm so exited for the finale season
469,The fantastic from George R R Martin is fantasy at his best. Great actors great action sometimes fantasy (dragons white walker). Often you can believe what you see... epic!
470,It have everything you want. If you are a human you need to see this
471,The only negative issue on this serie is the time we have to wait for next season!
472,Perfect tv show nothinh like it love it the most Must watch
473,"Before i watch got , I don't know what is series , all series begore got are juck , very very good, special denerys & john , got is life"
474,I love this show and will continue to watch it. :) King of the North Kit Harington. Oh nooo Sophie Turner. Game of thrones Game of Thrones (2011).
475,"Wasn't really my genre and it starts really slow. But season 7 is a solid 11/10, the best season I have ever seen in my life. It basically gets better and better. And has a ton of epic moments"
476,"As a huge fan I find this furiating: One can't help but wonder why they wanted to breeze through the books this fast where they clearly should've make multiple seasons per book and patiently wait for the last books to finish. And now they're trying to come up with multiple non-George R.R. Martin spin-offs as if there wasn't enough material? How about giving us everything we missed instead?? None the less, still one of the top series of all time."
477,Like this very much. And enjoy the time. I want this for 5 times. And read the book
478,"This is might not be the most thought provoking show or best written but my gods it's fun unless you don't like blood and guts . And let me be clear about it's fun , you not having fun when you see people get tortured or something but it's fun because it's a world that doesn't exist unlike realistic shows such as the wire, breaking or the sopranos. It also has for the most part a great plot line especially in my opinion at kings landing. Also if you like big fights dear. god you have to watch the show. The only reason I am not giving this a 10 out of 10 is because of season 7 wich got really stupid. But for the most part this is very fun show to watch if you don't mind violence and sex"
479,Waiting for last season :) I dont like it will not be aired this year. I could take 1 point cos of that!
480,The actors on the show are very good and it has lots of good scenes in the show to and i high recommend you watch the show because if you do not watch it you are missing out on one of the best shows out and they is lots of very interesting things in the show.
481,"Just EPIC.The story is the highlight of the series. ""GOT"" is an amazing TV series. It's full of adventures action, history, drama, magic. The series has a variety of unexpected Plots and turns that'll leave you Struck and in Shock. Every Season is itself an amazing. Writing, Direction everything is PERFECT. It's Awesome. I'm disappointed that we have so long to wait until 2019 season 8 comes out."
482,"Only one word can describe this phenomenon, it is ""Masterpiece"" . We can discuss about what ""Masterpiece"" means, but not contest its title."
483,This tv show is probably the best in his category but the main problem is that the season 8 starts after a year from the season 7 ended and that's really sad for the fans
484,"What. A. Show.

Arguably the defining television show of the last decade, Game of Thrones deserves every accolade it receives. Focusing on the rivalry and feudal affairs of the Great Houses of Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen, this show is both captivating for its action-packed set pieces and fit to bursting with emotional depth and intrigue.

A five star show from beginning to end, the cinematic-styled action pieces are unrivalled in their epic nature, in comparison to other television shows of this moment. Characters are well-defined and explored in an interesting and compelling way, keeping you guessing as to which avenue they will ultimately take, and whose side they are really on. Characters are evolved, storylines take unexpected twists and turns, and heroes are never, EVER safe.

This series is one that should not be missed. Once you start it, you'll be hooked and begging for more."
485,"Quality that adresses almost every problem in society with deep, real characters and excellent dialogues, but not in a teaching way and that is why many people do not get its meanings. People who deal with problems like scaring, crippling, fat issues, women not treated as equals, people who are misuderstood because they do not expain their actions or are realists, people with ideals, injustice, religion in its good and bad form, people born with problems, racism...everything adressed very well here..."
486,Everything in this tv-series is good enough to say absolutely fantastic job!
487,""" The Best show on TV which was based on Best Fantasy series in Print. The Show like the books have it all: intrigue on grand scale, treachery, murder, betrayal, war, terror, dark magic and darker deeds, brutal violence and steamy sex with cast unforgettable characters that live and breath!"
488,"The best series of all time Game of thrones ,the best series i have ever watched, filled with a lot of great and new ideas ,even though i didn't read the books that the story came from but everything is there in the show, i'm always waiting for the last season and can't even predict what's going to happen next, because if i did as always R.R. Martin will shock me again as he always did in the last seasons.

I have read a lot of other reviews and i'm surprised about what they say on nudity scenes , i totally agree with the existence of these scenes because they show the reality of what the world was like once upon a time and if it disturbs someone ,i'm sure there are a lot of family versions that contains less sexual contents.

Everything in the series was excellent(cast,actors,special effects ,soundtracks...) and everything was well done in the well known HBO way. I'm so eagerly waiting for the great finally of the last season and hope it would be as good as we used to see in other seasons,because after this one ,who knows when are we going to witness another great show as GAME OF THRONES."
489,"I love fantasy stories, but recently the only stuff to come out of Hollywood is full of porno and swearing. Really find that it cheapens the movie. Sad thing is that those scenes and the language are not even needed to make it a great story. This is my main point, these things are not needed, so why put them in? I mean what value do those scenes add? The F-word also feels like a modern word which should be left out of medieval stories. Perfect example of a great fantasy story is Lord of the Rings. Had none of that and it is one of the greatest movie's ever. It is a shame it looked like the story has so much potential was really into it until enough got enough."
490,"Charles Dance said in an interview with some gentle sarcasm that he would not read the books because they are too heavy to hold. That tells it all: great artists and filmmakers are doing their best to make an HBO quality show from a pulp fiction fantasy.

The story doesn't really go anywhere, characters can be killed anytime, new characters can be introduced as well, and the fantasy world is very far from believable. The budget can never be high enough to produce more than a couple of outstanding action scenes in one season so the writers (David Benioff has seen better days: 25th Hour, Troy) have to fill the gaps with long, never-ending and quite uninteresting conversations.

But, fortunately, the greatest stage actors also need the pay, so we can watch an amazing cast: Sean Bean, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Fairley, Carice Van Houten, the above mentioned Charles Dance and so on. Their presence worth watching the show.

Aside from that this is one of the weakest series of HBO, not even close to the quality of The Wire, Boardwalk Empire or Six Feet Under. The show could have told us something about human nature, power, politics, love, religion, faith and chaos, but instead of these we get a lot of nudity, pointless violence, and some Hollywood clichés.

You can say, it's just entertainment, so be it, but it still doesn't deserve more than 6 stars out of 10."
491,"Awful, awful, awful.

Firstly, the story takes a millennia to get going and after 3 episodes I was bored with the lack of solid storyline. I also became tired of the gratuitous foul language and sex scenes which for a fantasy drama were totally unnecessary, over the top and always in bad taste.

I haven't read the books and I'm not likely to now. It seems like either the author or the screenplay writer have a penchant to show as much female flesh as possible, portray women as mere sex objects and degrade females as much as possible by addressing them with slang and offensive names for female genitalia.

This series needs to go in the bin. Absolute rubbish."
492,"End of the first season : 10 episodes for about 10 hours. And what did it happen ? Almost nothing. One-dimensional stereotyped characters ""we don't care"" lost in infinite boring dialogs and a simple story who can stand in a stamp (I don't know about the books but I hope it's more consistent). But you could say ""forget the story, it's question of atmosphere"". OK. Look inside : the decor are cardboard made and look fake. And you often stay inside because outside it's not so easy to cheat. Also this is not an heroic fantasy story. There is no fantasy at all... except at the end of the last minute of the last episode. Before it's just like middle-age. Medieval stuff (sorry Dardaryen steel looks like ordinary steel) and barbarians ways (with a touch of dismemberment). Of course you have free nudity but completely pointless.

To sum up it's a very mediocre entertainment you have to avoid at all cost not to lost 10 precious hours of your life ! So do something else..."
493,"So for you people that want to write reviews or just leave a review rating, just say this show is a 10 and compare that show to this. Because this is a masterpiece. My father didn't ever like anything that could be fake, I showed him 1 episode and he was knowing more things about the show than I did and I loved it! For him to be into this show is like having a Snake and Mongoose being friends, unbelievable. That just shows the amazingness of this show. For someone that doesn't watch or is interest in fantasy or sci fi and actually love it. It shows a lot. I've been watching since I was 22 and my father at 54. So that shows that any age will love this."
494,"It's barely recognizable as coming from the source material, and the acting is a grab bag of good or abysmal. So much content, some of it very important, was cut altogether in order to craft a shody and fairly basic narrative. In spite of the massive budget of seasons 3-7 the show feels cheap."
495,"So I didn't have HBO and they offered it for free and I decided to watch GoT. At first it was interesting and it had promise, but then it quickly turned in to shock jock value.

Boobs are nice, but are they really needed? Sex? Why do you need it? Sure violence exists, but is it really needed? Bloodshed? sure but why so much of it? Is there not enough story and dialog to carry the show? Is all this other shock value to fill the emptiness.

I've watched a lot of movies and read a lot of books, but this isn't on the top of my list. There is some interesting crossover arcs with the story, there are some characters I want to see die, others that I want to see succeed. However that is about it with the first season.

I'll continue watching, but I don't expect it to be any better. It's cookie cutter stuff with out any real substance

(edit)

Just watched an episode which had some fighting. I'm familiar with ancient combat, weapons and armor. The scene was so completely unrealistic it was laughable. So much so I'm taking off two other stars.

This show uses deus ex machina too much. They need something to happen, so they just WHAM! kill some people, show some blood, have some sex.

(edit) So I noticed that they tend to repeat the story line a lot in the first season. I hope this is the case for the rest of the show.

To give you a small example. I watched the first three episodes and started to get a little bored. The show wasn't really progressing forward and seemed to stall.

By the fourth episode the show literally started to repeat scenes. I kept saying, hey that happened previously.

I went from episode #4 to #8 and didn't see anything new. It wasn't until the scene where the dance master fought the attackers that I found anything interesting.

And I thought these episodes were one hour long, but 3 1/2 minutes are a recap and intro, then there is 10 minutes at the end for some kind of director's dialog over what is happening in the show. These shows aren't even a full hour and they don't have enough content to fill it?"
496,"There is much intelligence evident in the writing for this series. The story is solid. But it's presented as something akin to The Lord Of The Rings, full of magic and wonder. It is not only boring and slow, this series, but it's relentlessly grim - like the daily news. I'd rather have the daily news. When I read it, I am looking for the info and expect it to be bad. When I'm looking for entertainment, while betrayal, destruction and good guys and gals loosing may be part of the story, I am not looking for only grim, which is what you get here. As for the supernatural and fantastic, it's next to non existent.

You have the odd shot of a cool looking kingdom and that's it. When it looks cool from a distance, once we get closer and behind the gates, there's the same old blah.

This isn't entertainment in any positive sense."
497,Dumbest show I've ever seen... Spend your time doing something worthwhile.
498,"With the exception of the first episode (due to terrible CGI blue- eyed monsters), I found the first series of this show quite gripping, with tense drama and witty dialogue.

The problem now is that it's more and more (and more) of the same, so what once seemed fresh and interesting seems hackneyed and boring.

Personally, the CGI always brings me out of the story, and the whole dragon-based/supernatural side of things, along with such scenes as the woodenly-acted Red Woman queefing a ghost out of her foofoo, just make me roll my eyes. If you like ridiculous CGI fantasy, clearly this will appeal.

Now, at season 6, we have hardly any of the wit and surprise of the earlier seasons, instead being left with lots of swearing, delivered by actors who don't seem like they can really be bothered any more. The scenes (now manifold) in faux-foreign tongues are embarrassing (perhaps this is a bit too subjective coming from me, as I am a linguist); in fact the whole thing is quite embarrassingly bad now.

I also had a realisation whilst watching S06E01, that this is basically Star Trek (NOT a good thing).

Actors now spend a lot of time stating literally what is happening or has just happened (""I did what I thought was right, and I got murdered for it, and now I'm back""...""He stabbed him in the back""...)."
499,"Unfortunately, after finishing seeing all the series, after all that wasted time, I can only say that it was the biggest rubbish I have EVER seen.....

And, I also have one advice for parents: keep it away from your children!!! As faraway as you can.... It is a disgusting image of a savage, primitive world, based solely on torturing people (mostly young women and children) and animals...."
500,"Well.... I just finished to watch the 2 episode of season 2 and I'm not impressed!! From the first few seconds of the first episode were that young boy have his face painted with black pen not mud (make up artist fault for sure) or the awful acting to the non attention to details. I really don't get it. Even the story is sooooooo predictable that it make me roll my eyes to see another American rubbish medieval series. This for me is a notch better than Zena warrior princess and that's mean not good. Please do not compare This to LOTR or you're dam too stupid to see the difference. I'm sure the books are fantastic to read but i hated the non attention to details in this series (people and places to clean, wolfs are husky dogs, clothes are to new and out of history context, etc....) but thanks for Sean Bean charisma and acting skills to make this series a bit more interesting then a pair of tits here and there. Anyway Not enough for me to watch the all series. Overall... great to watch as a teenager perhaps or if you don't care of the above. peace"
501,"I do not understand all the hype for this show. The first season is more about porn than anything else. Later that kinda fades away, and when characters are not walking naked it's actually s decent show. But that's it, i don't see anything special about it."
502,"50% of people watch this title because of the recommendation of the first 50%! In Iran, 90% of people watch and recommend this title because of Sex Senses and I'm sure about this one. I'm living with them trust me! This title is relying on its Sex Senses to keep the audience motivated. Full of negative points such as people behave like lying, flattering, drinking too much, treason, pay attention to pleasure houses, marching an army not just because of the sake of realms etc... Okay fine, all of these are correct on that specific era but there was Honor too and unfortunately, I don't see that too much! In the end, I have to say this title is not that BIG and EXCITING that the world says but it's worth to watch."
503,"Can't beleive how many people got into this show , watched the first 3 seasons and the i was dying from boardness , it has such a slow pace where each episode made me fall asleep !"
504,"You can have as many big stars in your film or series but it doesn't necessarily make it a winner. If you've seen The Cannonball Run 2 you'll understand where I'm coming from here.

I'm sure there are some quite good plots among the series and I won't criticise that, but the acting is unnecessary. When you go to see a play at a theatre the actors will, even if there supposed to emphasize whispering, will shout with much drama. This is so the people at the back of the audience can hear what's being said. You don't need to do this on television, they use microphones and the audience has a remote to control the audible volume. In Game of Thrones however, the actors have obviously forgotten they're no longer on a stage in front of a thousand people, so they carry on in the usual Shakespearean fashion and that for me completely vanquished any interest I may have otherwise had.

Now the thing I don't understand is this - the show has been on for about 5 years now, but it's only in the last year/18 months people have started talking about it. No wait, going f***ing mental about it. Why?! Why NOW!?

To some people this show has become a religion and that's fine, but they're also folk out there who enjoy voyeurism and that's umm....fine too."
505,"Game of Thrones is another one of those series that follows the trend of exploiting violence and sex to draw in an audience. Sex and violence would not, in themselves, be a problem, had they any context or relevance to the story of the development of the characters. Unfortunately, this is not the case here.

The series follows the story of a number of 'noble families' with fights for power and political intrigue occurring against a backdrop of a fabulous and fantastic world. The premise has potential, however the result is poor. The story is predictable and has been covered from a number of angles. The characters are one-dimensional, either good or bad, no in-between. The only exception to this being Tyrion Lannister, who makes quite an interesting character. There is a constant display of gratuitous violence that is displayed as if normal for the time. Seeing that this is fantasy, there is no historical accuracy to maintain, the violence and sexuality displayed are merely a choice of the writers and not historical depictions of a time and place that does not exist in the first place.

Also worrying is the normalisation of the mistreatment of women. Not only there are numerous prostitutes to pleasure the men in many occasions (and not useful for anything else), women are often referred to as 'whores'. It begs belief that this sort of misogynistic behaviour, which is offered as that of 'noble men' and therefore normalised, does not raise eyebrows or even disgust but instead praise and a number of Golden Globe nominations.

The acting is far from fantastic and what is it with those English accents coming up randomly? There are instances where the series shows potential and the characters display interesting and unexpected behaviour. Unfortunately this is not as often as it could be to support such as basic story."
506,"Let me begin by saying, I hated this series. My two daughters love it, but I don't want them to watch it any longer.

The only thing I remember from first season were tits. You can't create a series with only boobs in it. The story was very thin and it was confusing. There were too many characters in the movie. I didn't see any epic battles whatsoever. I expected Nightwalkers and Dragons all over the place. Instead, I, and I stress, see boobs. Only boobs. It was depressing, because my wife was jealous. She was so jealous that she went to have plastic surgery. It was a total nightmare in my opinion.

The blond girl, she was like 14. They dwarf was annoyingly short for my taste. And they all acted like they were from the medieval times. I simply can say, I hated this series.

But people seem to love it. And I don't blame for being short minded."
507,"Each week during ""Game of Thrones"" season, millions wait until Sunday nights to enter a world full of lust, violence, politics, power, and fantasy. This series is unlike anything ever done in the history of television, captivating audiences across the globe due to its magnificent content, brilliant writing, and highly entertaining medium. ""Game of Thrones"" is an adaptation of George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series, a ferociously original fantasy series that twists and turns away from traditional fantasy and creates a more authentic and genuine portrayal of a diverse and creative medieval fantasy universe. Set in Westeros and Essos, two mythical kingdoms, HBO delivers us a world unlike anything. Not only does the network offer groundbreaking visual elements such as CGI dragons, ice zombies, large-scale battles and state of the art costume and production, but they manage to make it feel real. You hardly realize you're watching a fantasy show. You get so engrossed in all the families and characters that it's hard to not care about everyone everywhere during every episode. With phenomenal performances and legendary characters, it's safe to say that there will never be a TV series this amazing ever made. ""Game of Thrones"" isn't just a show or a story. It's a culture that takes us far away and lets us experience a diverse amount of people in unthinkable locations, yet stays close to home with something everyone can relate to."
508,"This is the best season that has ever been aired for a long long time.What makes it so special is that every person who sees this season can gaze in its vast ocean of characters and find the one character that echos his personality that is the mirror image of his own self.

Rather than being showing a romantic,hollow and masked portrayal it is rude,bold,passionate,naked and above all the true depiction of the world.Where the wars are not as simple as it seems and love is not happy endings, marriages are held together not by love but by fear,anger,lust and children.Where kingdoms rise and fall on the deceit of men hungry for either power,glory or gold.Where honor to some means more than life but to others just a bunch of hollow words.

This season is a masterclass and i can easily say it is the Mozart of television.This season will pass the test of time for generations to watch the curious ways of the Game of Thrones"
509,"Saw series one & was SO impressed by the quality of the plot & the acting that i went straight out & bought the series of books (6 with 2 still to be written). Unfortunately, from book 2 onwards the books do not keep up any sort of pace & could easily have been condensed into 2 or 3 volumes. So, enjoy the TV series which is very true to the books (except that most of the main characters are portrayed as being twice as old as they were written). Yes there is lots of sex & violence, but not more than would be expected at that time in (fictional) history. This is ""Sparticus blood & sand"" NOT ""Zena warrior princess"" Series 2 is looking just as good. Hope this helps."
510,"This HBO series, somewhat reminiscent of The Lords of the Ring in plot and style, is based on the popular medieval fantasy books by George Martin (not the Beatles producer) and is basically about the struggle for power in the mythical Seven Kingdoms between two families, the evil Lannisters headed by the wife of the King, Queen Cersei (a fine performance by Lena Headey) and the more honorable Starks, who rule in the north of the realm, led by Ned Stark (a good turn as well by Sean Bean). There is a third dynasty as well, the Targaryen, related to the previous, murdered king, whose two survivors are the evil, bleach blond Viserys (a magnetic Harry Lloyd) and his beautiful, ethereal sister Daenerys (the petite Emilia Clarke, a revelation in a stunning performance). They live in exile among the savage Dothraki, a race of brutal, nomadic horse riders, and Viserys hope that the marriage of Daenerys with their leader Khal Drogo will help him raise an army of Dothraki to invade the Seven Kingdoms, overthrow the king and put him in charge of the seven kingdoms.

The series benefits from some great performances. Besides those I just mentioned, I have to add Peter Dinklage as the sardonic dwarf Tyrion Lannister, brother to the queen, and Jack Gleeson as the insufferable, cruel child heir to the throne, Joffrey. Not all performances in the series are remarkable, though: most of the Starks, especially Ned's sons, fail to make much of an impression.

The series has a very good start, then somewhat loses steam in the middle episodes, but rises again in the last two chapters for a rousing finale. I quite enjoyed the series, but I cannot call it a masterpiece. One problem that the many characters and the various, convoluted plots make it confusing at times. Some plot threads, especially the one in the frontier, could have been excised completely and the series would not have suffered. The stunning photography and locations certainly helps."
511,"Finally!!!

Someone has, at long last, figured out how to adapt a fantasy series properly, without butchering the books or the dialogue unnecessarily. Yaayy-Team!!! Now that you have figured it out HBO, how about doing Guy Gavriel Kay's ''Tigana''? That would be a blockbuster for sure!!! Who has the rights?? Well, whomever you may be, you've just been shown how to do it and do it well.

About time the TV land producers understood that we actually don't want any more mindless pap. And let's face it, a political drama/thriller is always a winner, no matter what world it's happening in."
512,"HBO raise the bar once again with this magnificent offering. Undoubtedly the best TV show of 2011. From the inventive and beautifully executed opening sequence GOT will have you gripped and take you on a roller-coaster of intrigue, deception and treachery. All beautifully set and shot, and acted by an outstanding and well cast ensemble.

GOT contains an excellent spread of heroes and villains, all of whom you will empathise with (apart from maybe Catelyn who was a bit 'meh'). While the story has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing throughout.

One special mention of Peter Dinklage, in an extremely well acted series his performance towers above the rest. Bravo Sir, and not a bad English accent for a Yank as well!

It's a cliché, but if you are going to watch one serialisation of a widely loved series of fantasy novels this year: make it HBO's 'Game of Thrones'"
513,"I decided to watch this series, in its first season, back-to-back, because of its respectable status here on IMDb. simply put, you wont be disappointed. at first, it might remind you of lord of the rings because of the genre, but the world of Game of Thrones is much more realistic, gritty, and unforgiving. It has magic, but the real magic is the dynamic relationships between the characters and the events that occur. it has great writing, and the pacing of the series when seen continuously is perfect. by the end of the series you'll be familiar with all of the families, kingdoms, and history of the Realm. the acting is superb; the characters you like, you love, and the characters you don't like, you HATE. the worst thing about this series is that it ends right when you want it to continue the most! i actually had to read the wikis on the books because i wanted to know what happened to the characters. season two should be even better and hopefully they will continue the series for sevens seasons, or however long it needs to be to cover all of the books.

this TV series/book series is EPIC storytelling. and its only season 1/book 1.

little advice: don't fast forward through the intro. it helps teach you the land of Westeros!

watch it!"
514,"Intrigue, action, perfect portrays of characters, vivid acting. It required all my attention since the dialogs were linked throughout the whole story and playback would have made me ruin the awesome epic flow of narration.

10 lines of review would be quite demanding in terms of praising possibilities to depict the hunger I had for watching the next episode during the whole of this 1st series. Watch this as it is not only meant to be a lesson in taste for viewers but also a masterpiece that probably won't be equaled for many years, a grindstone for film directors and aspiring movie stars. Do not watch it all at once as it requires your eyes and ears to be wide open.

I bow to the ART."
515,"Game of Thrones is probably one of the greatest series of all time,the production value is great,costumes,sceneries,music and atmosphere really drags you in an amazing world that in someway reminds me Lord Of The Rings ,of course this does not mean that its exactly the same but it has some elements of the Lotr World... Sean Bean is playing great the role Ned Stark,the other actors are also making a great job too.I suggest this movie to everyone,you will adore it and you will buy the books,its guaranteed!:) I suggest you to watch these series in HD with 5.1 Surround,these features enhance the whole experience. Whatever i will write i cannot describe the amazing feeling of watching this great series,try yourself the experience and you will be addicted to the imaginary world of the series!Let the game of thrones begin.."
516,"What a series! And the richness and depth of its characters! This gets my vote as one of the best TV series of all time. At the same time, I've been watching that drivel called ""Camelot"" (no more, though) and this fantasy series is what good viewing is all about and deserves an award.

Having read the books, I know that the story has been streamlined for television and it has probably been criticised for that reason but the essence is still there. It would be a mammoth undertaking, but I can only hope the producers of the series continues with all the books ( there are four in print with one due out next month and two more forthcoming). Keep up the good work, George!"
517,"I have seen may epic series and honestly got disappointed by many, so we stuck to Drama series for the past years, I thought after Lord of the rings , I would never witness something similar, I am not talking about the fantasy sci-fi but the whole emotion you get by just watching one scene I hurried and read ""song of ice and fire"" just to reduce my disappointment once I get to watch the series, but the trailer of Game of thrones left me and husband in AWE! Brilliant choice of cast, I can't pick or criticize any of them, as if they were made for this role throughout their lives and Sean Bean, isn't he the greatest? Can't wait to see more and more, i m in episode 6 now and looks very promising and each episode gets better .. Thats is the only series/ movies I would rate a 10... well deserved, great job from HBO, always giving the best I really hope that epic fans enjoy this series as much as I do.. George RR Martin will be very proud , a great author and a great adaptation"
518,"I watched this show recently after hearing people praising it for the last 5-6 years but I can honestly say now that it is a really bad show built on an immoral society and showing their lust for power. Only narcissistic personalities can write, watch and praise this show. Western Civilization has been a curse to the mankind since the start and all they care about is cut each other's throat or make them kneel by accepting their culture and religion. I have never even heard about a single moral ruler from the west. Shame on the creator and shame on the viewers for praising this nonsense instead of watching ideal king rule like in Ramayana or ideal justice like in Mahabharata."
519,"While I appreciate the idea that good guys don't always win, I don't need to watch something where the bad guys almost always do. There is enough bad news in real life to spend my time watching fictional attempts at depressing a viewer."
520,"A very sad sign of the times that this childish rambling nonsense can sit at the top of the best of tv charts , the people that voted it should get back to watching reality tv and look at Facebook or some other intellectually vacuous activity"
521,"I never read any of the books, so I have no input there. Since this show is very popular, I decided to watch it since I was told how amazing it is. Well, thought I think the production is amazing and well-done, I find the story to be pretty boring and predictable. There are so many characters in this show that it is difficult to follow at times. I am just not impressed by the show and don't really care much about any of the characters. I think it's a pretty shallow show. Take away all of the BS with their long winded dialogue and all you have is a fight for power, wars, drinking, f'ing, and a bunch of laughable fantasy garbage. I cannot relate to any of the characters because the story is so ridiculous and none of them really open up, they are all just caught up in sitting on ""the iron throne"". If you're going to waste time watching anything from start to finish on HBO Go, make it the Sopranos over this!"
522,"Game of Thrones, what can you say! I imagine everyone has seen it by now and either love it or hate it! I did both, I hated the first episode I saw but gave it a chance and now love it!

I have many questions about Game of Thrones like why was John Snow initially only suppose to be 16 years old when he looks 25?

I would have liked different actors playing main roles like Amelia Clarke who really can't act but seems to be popular due to the dragons! Can't viewers recognize bad acting these days!

The last few seasons have been a tad INSULTING to the viewers considering we only get short seasons! The first few seasons were sensational with constant story progression and episodes full of drama highlighting most of the families in the show. I can't believe viewers like episodes that seem to be lazy and cheap to produce and focus on one thing with no story progression whatsoever. They throw in a dragon scene and everyone goes nuts and thinks the show is great except for those who have a brain!

I hope the next season goes back to the original formula of the intricate story line and constant story progression!"
523,"Based on the bestselling fantasy book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin – often referred to as ""the American Tolkien"" – HBO is betting that fans of The Lord of the Rings will come to this for a sprawling, interwoven tale of feuding families, swords, sex, carnage, beasts, frayed loyalties, deception, intrigue and the pursuit of power. As well they should. Game of Thrones has all the elements (many described above) that lure viewers to shows like The Sopranos, et al. That it's a fantasy series shouldn't scare anyone away, because – like Lord of the Rings – there's a real allure to costume-dramas that pair dense mythology with all of the crowd-pleasing elements of war, honor, pride, lust, power and, yes, even humor. Thrones has all of those in spades and supports them with exceptional storytelling, strong writing, superb acting and some stunning visual effects!!!Must watch for everyone!!!"
524,"Without a doubt this show is one of the most popular shows on television right now but if the final season delivers in the way all the other seasons have it will be regarded as one of the best shows ever. It has seriously everything. Action, suspense, love, jokes, and amazing characters. 10/10 would recommend to anyone."
525,"Just watch and you will see.

It gets better and better, and now its just a wait for season 8 to see how it all ends. Best show ever."
526,"I have no words to describe the masterpiece called ""Game of thrones"". All I have to say is: if you haven't seen it yet, START TODAY"
527,"This is the best series I've ever watched, and I watch a lot of them. The characters, the politics, the hidden messages, everything is perfect. Normally fighting scenes are special and cool in series, but with GoT everything is perfect. Not saying the battle scenes aren't cool, because they're amazingly well shot and thought out aswell. I really wonder what season 8 is going to be like and how everything is going to play out. Can't wait!"
528,Every word is less to describe this series. That's it! Understandable enough.
529,"You'd have to be an idiot to not like this. Simple

Action, romance, fantasy etc

It has it all. The soundtrack too is brilliant.

If youre reading reviews for this then im guessing you have no friends. Either way, watch it."
530,"Nothing to say, this is just the best show ever made. If you are lucky enough to not have seen it, you are in for a hell of a ride! And it even gets better the second time you see it as you will have a better understanding of the story"
531,Hands down best show ever to grace our tv screens..hands down......enough said
532,"First Sopranos, then Breaking Bad, and now Game of Thrones. We are all living in the greatest times for entrainment, through the TV series.

The characters, the storyline, the script, the acting, the cinematography, and the attention to detail makes Game of Thrones, hands down, the king of television.

If you don't like stories about fantasy or medieval times, but you enjoy watching great stores, then try the first 5 episodes Game of Thrones. By then, you should be hooked."
533,"Before you gonna die, you must watch GAME OF THRONES..."
534,"I became a huge fan of the Game of Thrones since the first episode , it deserve more than 10 in everything performance , sound track , story line and the script . when a great team work together for sure they will make a great thing , I commend and I would like to thank Peter Dinklage for his performance , absolutely he deserves all the awards that he got and he was masterpiece . Great greeting to George Martin for the an incredible story what he wrote . In general it was truly an amazing series ."
535,"I recommend it to everybody, just watch it once in your lifetime."
536,"As a big fan of the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series I was thrilled when HBO announced this series, but also somewhat ill-at-ease after having seen so many other much loved books ruined in screen adaptations.

Overall I think HBO have done an outstanding job, especially in the area of casting. The characters come across almost exactly as I imagined them in the books, and some even better. In particular I've been hugely impressed with the work of Jack Gleeson as Joffrey. I seriously want to strangle that little $%^* - which is kinda the point!

The visuals are also stunning, with dragons, giants, and white walkers seamlessly integrated into the scenes.

Of course, as with any die-hard fan I have my gripes. The replacement of Jeyne Westerling with Talisa Maegyr, seemed clumsy and unnecessary. It appears that the producers wanted a more ""romantic"" storyline.

The omission of Strong Belwas is also disappointing, and leaves me wondering how they will cover some of his role in future parts of the story.

But these complaints are minor, and certainly do little to diminish the overall mastery of this story by the cast and crew, for what is surely one of the most talked about TV shows in history, inspiring a multitude of only fan sites - and even an online coloring book (http://www.gameofthronescoloringbook.com)!"
537,I believe there are still many flaws with this series. Like how many before it just was full of blood and gore overshadows any deep storylines
538,"This show was hyped so much that I couldn't wait to see it. The production values seemed high and the actors are of great lineage. So what went wrong? Well I blame myself really. I got older and now when I watch a programme I'm more interested in plot and character development than lingering shots of women entering a bath. Now don't get me wrong here, if that shot was required for the development of the show, put it in by all means. But most of these scenes were totally gratuitous. Plus there seemed to be a gender bias at work, there were no shots of male frontal nudity.

In conclusion I think that this show was made for males aged 18-35. Fine no problem there. I just don't think that I fit that profile any longer."
539,"Game Of Thrones is one of the best TV show till date. One of the main reason people love about this show is every character has an interesting story to tell. Many reviewer don't mention about the casting , the actors cast for every character is spot on. No one character is miss cast.

The show rightly depicts the various aspects of that particular era the story took place from costumes to the cultures. The show delivered quality episodes every time.

It is a must watch show if you like fantasy or even if you haven't watch any before and if you are OK with blood and gore because there will be lot of killing and lots of blood and gore."
540,"Most boring major show ever -- I gave up during season two -- nothing was happening, and the entire story is just like a bloodthirsty medieval royal family, France to be exact, where he got the idea, from series of historical French novels taking place in the 13th century..

The only thing making it ""modern"" or a fantasy is apparently a dragon, which never appeared while I watched.. then a friend said that big wall in the wilderness was to keep out zombies? unreal - how trivial, and unimaginative.. when you want vapid fans to flock to see it, add vampires or zombies or both..

Lowest common denominator stuff, just made with big money... I don't have a decade to spare to wait for this to unfold more violence and greed, that's been done so often that there's nothing illuminating or cathartic in it for me, but apparently it's new to people who are probably new to life itself, like those under 30..

My hope is that before finishing the book series or the TV show, George Martin will suddenly die, that would be appropriate.. his SF writing is much better to me, like Sandkings.. check it out..

I give it five on production values alone, and Peter Dinklage's acting, but he's better in The Station Agent"
541,"I have finished the first season of Game of Thrones and all I can say is that it was simply fantastic! Boardwalk Empire has been the HBO series that has gained the most attention, but in all honesty I felt a little disappointed by that one. Here, it's anything but.

First off, for a medieval fantasy television series, the performances are all fantastic. Every single performer steps up to the plate. Sean Benn and Michelle Fairley are as perfect protagonists as one could hope for. Yet the ones that even outshined them at times include Lena Headey (who at times you feel her pain and at times you just want to cut her head off), Nikolaj Coaster is also pretty fantastic, as is Peter Dinklage (who is the most likable Lannister!). Kit Harrington and Richard Madden are pretty incredible as well and show great future potential. The directing and writing are not over-dramatic and the story lines are actually pretty unpredictable after a while. Yet there are still many melodramatic moments, but for the better.

The art direction is superb, as is the cinematography as expected. This is basically watching a film. I don't want to overdo these statements since I am sure everyone pretty much knows it, but overall, this was fantastic season. Oh, and the music score and opening credits are the best on TV!"
542,"1. I do not care for fantasy. 2. I despise HBO. Having gotten those two caveats out of the way, I was recently subjected to the first five episodes of this HBO series. I found it talky, flatly directed and under-budgeted, which is nothing new with TV series or miniseries. At the same time, I was surprised by the quality of some of the acting, especially Lena Headley, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, and the cinematography, which brought this alternate universe world to life. I also understand the script adheres fairly closely to the book, probably because the author was responsible for translating it to the screen. From what I saw of it, I would warn prospective viewers not to expect another LORD OF THE RINGS. It reminded me more of DUNE. As with so many HBO shows, there's some gratuitous sex and nudity, including truly repulsive scenes where a 10 year old boy suckles at his mother's teat and an effeminate man performs fellatio. There's also some gore and violence, although not enough for this gore-and-violence fan. I understand some of the worst cruelty in the book has been eliminated. Thank god for small favors. This show is for adult fantasy fans and those who like to be titillated, like the individual who made me sit through the first five episodes. At times, it verges on the pornographic."
543,"Writing- 7 (Starts pretty great, but falls to embarrassing lows in S7 and declines in general after GRRM left)

Acting- 7 ( Most main actors are slightly above average and none are truly great, though many actors are ""average"")

Plot/Story- 7 (Becomes overly simplified and too far fetched for even a ""fantasy"" show by season 6-7, especially 7. The story ""drags"" out by seasons 6-7, so much so that it starts to lean more towards bad than good)

Characters- 6 (So overrated. This is probably the part of the show's popularity that baffles me the most. I honestly only really enjoyed 2 of the show's 40-50 main characters, and then there was a 3rd one I somewhat liked. Everyone else is either forgettable or just okay. The show's main fans talk about all of these characters like they love them, and it's just perplexing since most are dull, boring, and mediocre.)

Costume Design/Set Design/CGI/Production Values- 10. This is the one and only thing that is truly elite about the show, but it is without a doubt top notch. There is no denying that these are the categories where Game of Thrones truly excels and rises above most other shows. But that's like a typical CGI-laden Hollywood comic book or sci fi action flick with a thin script and mediocre acting.

All this said, is it good? Yeah, it's good. In fact it is very good, but it is nowhere near the hype and over the top popularity it gets. The fandom for this show is somewhat unsettling. It's like nobody really expresses how they really feel about it. They all jump on the bandwagon and dare not anyone criticize the show because it's the best ever because all the obsessed fans say so so it must be true.

Meh. I like it, and I'll watch the final season, but I will definitely admit that half of the reason I'll be watching is just to continue to see how much of a decline in quality it has become since GRRM left the writing team. The other half just wants to see how it ends, and if one of my predictions comes true, which if it does, I will be disappointed since it would be too predictable."
544,"After watching four episodes, I have to say that I really love the series so far. I have not read the books, and I haven't been a fantasy- fan at all really before I watched the series. It is amazing! The third episode was maybe a bit slow, but other than that, I really feel the tension and the characters really growing on me. I disagree with most bad reviews that say it is boring, to slow, to fast and that the actors are misplaced.

I really like all of the good characters, and do not like the evil ones, but that is because they are evil characters and not because they are misplaced or bad actors. Ned Stark is very tasteful, also his sons - as a woman, I really like them. The atmosphere is realistic and I'm looking foreward to winter when the story probably turns even darker.

I don't feel violated as a woman watching this - I love that they don't sensor the reality like most American series would have. It is harsh and true, and I really feel it in my bones. I think it would only get better and better. No series is for everyone! That is just something to accept. But for most people this series clearly is fantastic, hence the rating."
545,"Wow just wow . This show surpassed my every expectation by far .

Excellent acting. Very good cast. Beautiful scenery. 4 episodes in and i simply cant wait another week for the 5th one . The story and even the dialogs stay true to the books. I really can't understand the bad reviews few posted here. How brain dead someone needs to be to not appreciate this masterpiece.Simply one of the best shows to hit TV. Usually i skip few weeks in order to watch few episodes at once but with this show i just cant hold it .

Do not listen to the childish reviews if you love deep plot, evolving characters,epic scale then this show is for you !!"
546,"Game of Thrones clearly has good production values, good acting and beautiful women.

But the story (or the script) is a potent sleep inducer. After watching this show for 30 minutes I could not care less who was who, what are their plans, and etc.

These tales of intrigue and high drama mixed with stereotypical notions of bravery, deception, honor, treason, loyalty, royal lineage etc. are so passé that one wonders why people keep on making films and writing books about them. Not to mention that reading and hearing about kings and queens and all this nonsense has become a chore. How many films and book have been written based on this quasi-medieval quasi-mythical ideals?

That is why lately there are always some naked skin, exposed breasts, rough-sex scenes (e.g. Spartacus) on these productions. The directors need to get the attention of the viewer, right? Otherwise, people would simply turn to other things which are a little bit less dull, confusing and uninteresting.

Can't those guys create more interesting alternative realities? Does it always have to be about power, murder and sex? All in all, this type of tale is nothing more than a medieval version of Dallas....

Yep, you've seen one, you've seen them all!"
547,"I have read the books (the first three I have read twice, the fourth once). I love the books. So in theory I am pre-disposed to either like the series or hate it because it is not sufficiently like the books. It would be damn near impossible for me to judge the series as if I had not read the books. I have only seen the first two episodes of the series.

All that said, I love the series. The casting is phenomenal. The acting better than some of the best mini-series. Tyrion is spot on (a phenomenal acting job and a phenomenal character). Jon Snow is spot on. Arya Stark, Cersei Lannister, Jaime Lannister etc, etc. The series clearly gives the feel for the book and is true in its characterizations. No series will have every plot detail of a book nor will it have every character exactly as every individual sees him/her, it can't, but this series is very true to the book, true to Martin's writing and true to the character of each player. I can't wait for the next episode. I want to own the series on DVD (Blu ray). I want to go back and read the books."
548,Show writers and Director of the show don't care about fans any more. They just want to end GOT as soon as possible.
549,"GOT is not simply a fantasy saga, is a wonderful collective drama about humans and their conditions. It is a deep thought about how the human soul can react, change and evolve during its life in reaction and in response to the happenings taking place in their lives. It is like a study from different angles and perspective, conducted on so many kind of people, of all social conditions and type. And, moreover, it is beautifully shot with great performances by the actors."
550,"The leap of faith HBO took with GoT has repaid itself 10 fold. The original material (books), from George R.R. Martin, have the excellent basis to make the show as good as it is, which begs Hollywood to revisit excellent plot-lines instead of expensive CGI or big name actors with little talent.

Game of Thrones is the show that offers you Medieval times but with the added draw of devious politics and exciting battles (plus dragons)."
551,"Game of Thrones is based on a series of novels written by the very talented George R. R. Martin. The show contains everything a truly amazing show should. The acting is phenomenal and the accompanying cinematography, story, sets, visual effects, and writing simply can't be found anywhere else. GoT tells human stories in a fantastic world running rampant with magic and otherworldly things that provide thrills and really hook a watcher in. The show is well done and one that shouldn't be passed up. All the characters (even the villains) are nearly impossible not to get extremely attached to. If you think important characters in other movies or television shows have met gruesome deaths your whole view will change after seeing Game of Thrones. Truly no character is safe. In conclusion the show is the best show that there ever has been or will be. A man will always love Game of Thrones. The acting is amazing and the story is gripping beyond belief. Give Game of Thrones a watch!"
552,"Each episode is usually about 55 minutes long, take out the ridiculous 2 minutes (!) intro and final credits and you get 52 minutes which suppose to cover more than 10 story lines. In a good episode we get to see about half of them. In a very good episode something actually happens in the sub plots.

Sooner or later we will get tired of waiting, so why not to put some more meat into the story and make longer episodes?

Don't tell me it will be expensive because they will cover it with 3 more commercials..

There is more than enough material to write longer episodes and the production value of the series will be able to hold it.

Who else think that each episode should be 90 minutes long?"
553,"I do not know why people complain of too much skin and no plot....so maybe just maybe the sex is too much but it,in no way interferes with the plot or the storyline in such a way that the viewer loses interest in the show, The show gathered up so many unexperienced actors (with the exception of Sean Bean,Lena Headey,Nikolaj-Costau Waldow and Peter Dinklage) and made it one of the best acted and vastly storylined TV shows of all time,following the books written by George Martin (dubbed by many as the successor of J.R.R Tolkien) but if you are a fan of fairy tales this show is not for you. I cannot believe why this show is shut out in almost all the award shows as it obviously deserves to win a lot more awards than it already has as it is THE highest ranked TV series still continuing,along with Breaking Bad (another must watch show) in IMDb. 10/10 an unbelievably awesome TV show"
554,"First of all, I have only read the 1st book, ""Game of Thrones"" because I wanted to read after I saw the first few episodes of the series. First of all, putting a face to the characters is worth it. HBO and the actors have done an amazing job making every single person exact to how their character is in the book. Dialog is, for the most part, word for word and it's pretty simple to divide the book into ten parts and read accordingly.

Overall its a fantastic fantasy series that most people will relate to Lord of the Rings, even though it really is NOTHING like it aside from it being grand-scale, having Sean Bean, and having funny sounding names for things.

Each episode is better than the one before it and even if you think the first few are a little slow, you'll relish them compared to the intense, often breathtaking pace the series jumps to during the latter half of episode 4.

Finally, its HBO...there will be nudity, swearing, and violence....of the 3 I will say the nudity is a tad overdone...while exposition is revealed during most of the scenes and is very important, it boarders on late-night cinemax, especially during episode 7.

10/10, for story, acting, cinematography, and being faithful to the origin. Even if you don't like LoTR (I don't), its just fun to watch."
555,"So I had heard of this new series and was interested to see how it was. Within the first 10 minutes, I had to text friends to see who else had watched this. Its crazy good. Ever watch a movie and when its over you feel pumped up? this does that. for sure.

It has everything an HBO series is expected to have. Violence, nudity, language, and an awesome story line. I ended up watching the first 6 episodes the first night, staying up until around 5am.

This is not the usual mid-evil show/movie with kings and queens and fluff. this is action packed, a twisted story line, its fantastic.

Try to not blink"
556,"Having finished the book just before the TV adaption , it is still very fresh in my mind , and I am very impressed with the TV series so far.

The remarkable thing to me is that , all the characters and locations look almost exactly as they did in my mind's eye. With the use of CGI and larger budgets , TV companies are now able to make programmes much more faithful to books than they were able to before.

The acting is all excellent , and a special mention must go to Peter Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion Lanister which is terrific.

I'm really looking forward to the final few episodes of the series and will then read the next book in the series."
557,"What a thrill! I was so excited to find out that HBO actually had placed all the episodes on HBO on demand.

I've seen most of the episodes and so far so hot! The landscape in the show is gloriously beautiful.

The actors are all so interesting. I don't recognize any of the actors but they are all perfect for the roles they play.

I like the midget actor. He could quite possibly be the best actor on their show.

I enjoyed the jousting scenes. It is a television series that I hope will be around for a long time."
558,"I am appalled at the amount of violence and sexy wexy times in this series. I imagined it to be a family friendly film/documentary about kingdoms in the dark ages - but this is riddled with inappropriate content for children!

TLDR: Don't let your kids watch this!"
559,"I didn't read the book, nor did I ever heard of it. Second; I watched the first 6 episodes so far Most reviews are mainly positive, but many of those are written by the book readers. If one feels that you have to read the book to enjoy the series this review is not for you.

This series is a drag. I think thats the best way to describe it. Its a never ending introduction of people whom may become important later or whom may not, you don't know for sure. Its about intrigue, backstabbing, leadership, honor, good, evil all that.. but it doesn't deliver. Some things happen, and if it does the show will definitely let you know ""something"" happened. Even if its not that special it will become the main part of the story for to long.

Six episodes is almost 6 hours, nothing 'epic'/'grand' happened. All six hours is talk and no show. You might see a sword fight or two (not much more), but no battles or some breath holding scenes. Even those who love this series cannot deny this. There are no real scenes in it, which will 'take you away', in lack of better words.

So far, to me, this is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. You keep switching from story line to story line, and although they are put together nicely it just gets boring after an hour or 4. Once again I'd like to state that nothing really happens.

Conclusion!?Each episode has some brutal fighting with someone beheaded or loosing their eye before dying. It looks like an awful clone of MK fatalities. Then out of the blue there's sex and swearing. I mean, What the Freak?!!! What makes you people rank this 9.5 of 10? IT IS LOUSY AND PATHETIC... I'm sorry, this series just sucks..."
560,"I used to really love this show when it first came out but after Season 3...""The Red Wedding"" specifically, I've really grown to despise it. Its completely predictable and the change in tone doesn't help either. The characters feel under-developed and the atmosphere is not as chilling as it used to be! What I hate most is the abysmal, unnecessary violent nature it seems to be portraying. Was there any need to kill 'THAT' many characters in the red wedding? No.

It used to be a well written, well crafted show but now it has turned into something sadistic and completely unimaginative. I give it a 3 only because of the well done Special Effects."
561,"I am beginning to think that when HBO or Showtime makes a new series, no matter what it's about, they get together and discuss how much graphic sex they can add to titillate the viewers...""Game of Thrones"" is a very rich and complex story, so what's with all of the x and sometimes XXX rated stuff that they ad to it...It's such a shame to see a piece of good and well made storytelling adapted to the screen, only to have it ruined by material that it just doesn't need....I can understand that Producers realize that by putting in graphic sex scenes, that viewers will tell their friends and they will thus get more viewers,but this is really a crying shame that they have added it to this complex story...A Shame..."
562,"Good show. I like that the show kept close with the books. But I think ""The Song of Ice and Fire"" deserved more. If HBO built a small part of Rome for the similar show, they could have invested more here. Maybe they were hit by the crisis or they simply failed to foresee the great potential of the story. I understand they can't afford the LOTR visual effects or John Woo for fighting scenes, but all that close filming angles and the lack of panorama create a feeling that we're watching a theater play on a stage. Almost all the scenes (e.g.: the Wall, the Hand Tournament, the Cloud Castle) could have offered much more greatness with just a few extra money (or maybe imagination). I'm afraid to think how the epic battles scenes will look (if any). I'm sure GoT brings enough audience to HBO (the book fans community is large enough) to make them invest more in the following series."
563,The most overrated serie i've ever seen it has a lot of mistakes idk how the writer did this. he was drunk when he wrote the scènes senario ??
564,"This show is simply amazing in every aspect possible, from the acting to the visuals & one of the most overlooked aspects, the score (music) of the series. This show is truly captivating in more ways than one. It's everything an ancient war fantasy should be & more. The plot & character development are nearly perfect as you you follow the 7 kingdoms through their story lines, and each season gets better. I've seen Breaking Bad, Sopranos among many other great shows & as amazing as those are, this is THE show. I promise with just a few episodes you will be hooked, trust me! And not to mention the show has so many plot twists that you literally have no idea what could happen next, easily a 10/10 & my favorite show of all time. This show will suck you in from an emotional standpoint to the point where you will become a fiend for more, just like I'm dying for Season 7 as we speak"
565,"Great acting, great photography, setting and story! The creativity and imagination is a joy to watch.

I give this 2 stars due to the raunchy nature of the script, and its strong misogynistic elements that are in just about every episode. It seems to render this story much more a film of our age, rather than a timeless classic that it could be.

Incidentally, if this is a mirror of our times, then we are headed for some dark days indeed. Some say Frankenstein was pushing the boundaries back in the day, and the violent 70's screamer horror films was another genre that pushed the boundaries. Screamer horror films evolved, and those old screamers are a rare sight these days. The same will happen to this series. We will move on, and evolve. I'm glad I didn't invest my money in the production.

It makes me also quite sad to think the level of lack of respect shown in this series is required to gain public attention, which I don't believe is true. I think it cheapens the series, and is definitely unnecessary. My toes cringe every time a scene that is clearly sadistic and unnecessary comes on.

A great story, told well and photographed beautifully, is all that is needed.

This series has lost 2 viewers from my household after watching just Series 2 for these reasons. We doubt much will improve, and fear it will only get worse. After reading some reviews, it seems to be the case.

We'll be moving onto far more worthy programs such as True Detective and Penny Dreadful - great story telling, great acting, photography and scenes that remain in line with the story itself.

The Hobbit film trilogy will remain my firm favourite in terms of fantasy epics - a film that holds its integrity without relying on naked bodies and sadistic shock tactics to sell it."
566,"İf you are a great fan of the book series, you have to watch season 1! An adaptation of words to words, no extra nonsense Hollywood lines! Everything was as İ have imagined while reading the books! İ watched the full season in one night and lived with its magical music in my ears for a while! Yet, stop with this happiness before you move to season 2 And prepare yourself to extra, stupid scenes that does not exist in book; many events missed or falsely changed; shallow characters that say stupid Hollywood typical words! The events are so cut that they do not make a whole anymore, they do not add up! No magic, no loyalty to the book and no respect to the many fans! My advise: unchange whatever you have changed in season 2 and give us back the best fantastic series and best adaptation i have seen!"
567,"I'm very much in two minds about Game of Thrones. While I do not get the amount of hate we see here, I cannot share the enthusiasm that so many people seem to feel. Up until season 3 when certain undesirable strains started to appear (see below) I found it watchable, although no masterpiece.

By mid season 3 I did find it going downhill for the reasons below.

Things I like about GOT:

1. Complex interwoven story-lines. George R.R. Martin has cleverly assembled a number of stories designed to appeal to everyone. There's a little girl in disguise on a quest, a little cripple boy on a quest, a bastard son on a quest, a masculine woman on a quest, along with various royal pretenders seeking the throne. Then there's the dwarf (of course!), the eunuch, the sadist pimp...the only thing missing is the effeminate male.

2. No concession made to the viewer. From the very start the viewer is thrown headlong into the story and expected to pick up on names, locations and family allegiances. Certain ideas are mentioned in passing and then come to fruition episodes later without any recap given. This series demands careful viewing.

3. Unpredictability. Key characters are killed suddenly and unexpectedly without fanfare.

4. Good scenery.

5. The imp. Peter Dinklage is the star of GOT.

Things I don't like about GOT

1.Gratuitous nudity. These are the now notorious ""sexposition"" scenes where lengthy amounts of dialogue are delivered to shots of naked women. In the first series a certain amount of male nudity is also shown but this disappears in later series.

2.Gratuitous swearing. Sometimes, such as when a group of men are gathered together, the copious use of the c-word and other strong oaths seems appropriate, but in mixed company it does not ring true.

3. Gratuitous violence. No so much a problem in the first 2 series but in scenes 3 a deeply unpleasant strain of ""torture porn"" begins to develop.

4. Darkly lit. While this certainly makes GOT very moody, it is sometimes hard to see what is meant to be happening in the numerous night time scenes.

5.Increasingly predictable. After the surprising developments up the the middle of series 2, it has become a soap opera, with loads of sex and violence but little real danger (at least for the main characters).

6. Silly plot developments. This was the decisive factor in me turning against the series. Some guy with a ""magic penis"", the warrior woman (who had been previously and admirably plausibly shown as being manly) turning into a sexy lady and worst of all, someone with the ability to bring back the dead, a development that makes me worry that some of the interesting things in previous series may be undone."

569,"This show is from another level, really!

Yes I've read the books, but still, I love Game of Thrones. Sure, season one is a little bit slow, but it's for your own good because there are hundreds (probably even more) of characters that you need to get to know before the adventure can start. Still, season one ends with a bang! (So please, don't give up too soon... You'll regret it)

The story is rather complicated, but the acting, special effects, storytelling, music, ... everything is so well executed! Even if you're not a fantasy fan, I highly recommend you this show!

But please. Don't get too attached to a certain character, because... valar morghulis."
570,"TV shows I rated 10 are extremely rare, I could count them on one hand. And this is one of them. Excellent crew did this based on fantastic book and in cooperation with original writer... I do not want to compare this show with anything else because it is beyond any comparing, but speaking only about its quality, this is for TV world what Lord of the Rings is for movies. I doubt anyone will top this any time soon.

New books are not out yet, and they decided not to wait for it, so series are ahead of the books now. I did not watch the latest season yet, and I see many bad impressions and comments on web, but even if they really did lousy job on this last season, previous 5 seasons are so good that last one can not spoil average grade below 10/10.

I must admit, I did not see famous Breaking Bad yet, so I can not be 100% sure, but for me this is the very best TV show ever made.

I am not writing about it's contents, there is more than enough spoilers all around the web, so no need for me to add some more. Thou, I do not understand all that noise and complaining about spoilers, especially if movie/series is based on famous book. In my opinion, you should always read the book before you watch it on TV, and if you did it then you already know most of what you'll see, so complaining about spoilers is ridiculous. And believe me, even if it is not always the case, in this case you really SHOULD READ THE BOOKS FIRST. It is impossible to put all those thousands of pages in TV show, and reading the books will allow you much better understanding of what you see and you will enjoy the show much much more. I'm not saying that the books are better. Not this time. Both are great in its own way. But show will hypnotize you even deeper if you read the books first."
571,"I've never raved about something on TV so much in life! There is nothing' quite like Game of Thrones!

I recall people talking about it years ago in its first three seasons.. But I'm one who doesn't like what the majority like, I don't love trendy or popular things. Roll on a few years, I was in my local CEX and the boxset (seasons 1-4) was on the shelf in pristine condition.. I traded in some unwanted DVDs & then purchased the boxset. I got home, put in disc one and was hooked for the next two & a half weeks, getting through three or four episodes some days.

That's how I came to love Game of Thrones, by chance.. If you're anything like me & willing to give something a go just to see what all the fuss is about, do yourself a favour & do it!

The acting is second to none, the vastness of the world will leave you in awe, the way the story unfolds will leave you mesmerised... The shocks, the twists & turns.. This is a fantasy genre but there's a realism to it all! The action sequences aren't over the top, they are realistic. That's why even Lord of the Rings doesn't compare to Game of Thrones (I love Lord of the Rings) but you know what's going to happen, the good guys will prevail. Who are the good guys in Game of Thrones? Will they come out on top? This is another reason why Game of Thrones is realistic, because there is no good vs bad; everybody has goodness & some evil in them as well.. That's true for all of us, well more so to the people it's based on in history.

I even watched all of Breaking Bad after I'd watched Game of Thrones.. It just doesn't compare.

Nothing is on the scale of GoT.. It's a one off & when all is said & done it will be hailed as the greatest show of all time!

The end of season six highlighted the fact it's still the most shocking show on TV today! I've never felt so many different emotions watching anything on TV! I was left with euphoria after watching the final episode of season 6!

If you've watched it all, you'll know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, give it a go, see how it affects you... I'm sure it will have you addicted so you can't wait for another hit of Game of Thrones!

The best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be!"
572,"George R.R. Martin's magnum opus, A Song of Ice and Fire, has been adapted into one of the finest television shows in recent memory and is quickly and easily pushing the boundaries of television production and its own network, HBO. Like most HBO productions, the stories are like film serials that show us stories that would be too much for any single 2-hour movie to tell. Game of Thrones is a world-encompassing epic of heroes, anti-heroes, magic, bastards and dragons, and the best dwarf on television: Tyrion Lannister.

If I were to put to words how to describe this magnificent show, I would say just this one: Grand! Everything about Game of Thrones is masterfully done with hardly any fault. The world of Westeros is incredibly dense and not full of your black-and-white locations in a typical television drama; many of the places are different, sharing their own beauties and terrors, like The Wall, and King's Landing.

The same traits can also be said about this show's cast of characters, which is still an ever- growing plethora of protagonists and antagonists to root for or against them. Yet even with this ever-growing patch, you realise in the end that they're all still inhabiting the same world, like a true epic fantasy story does so wonderfully.

Game of Thrones is the show of the generation, the magnum opus of the small screen and an unsurpassed world-builder."
573,"First of all, I don't say this show sucks, but it sucks hard comparing to the books.

This show began with a great potential, until they started to be unloyal to the book series.

I personally think that the relations, wars, etc. are well told in the books, however, they decided to change these in the TV series (which I don't know why), they started by not even mentioning really important parts, they also started creating new stories which are stupid comparing to the ones within the book.

And the new story they created is really became dumb.

I cannot believe how George Martin let them to ruin a masterpiece like this.

All I ever wonder about this show is why did they decide to ruin this story by changing it this much (and changing it with untalented scenario writing), instead of writing/creating a new story,not related to GOT.

My beliefs for this series are similar to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, which was ruined in a similar way. Those movies were not bad either, but Jackson changed the story too much, and it led me to think the same - why ruin this one and not create a new goddamn story not related to Hobbit?

I simply cannot understand.

If they stood loyal to the books in GOT (I admit it's impossible to stay loyal %100, but I'd expect at least not changing the story), it'd be a great, I mean really great show.

But now, it has become only a ""good show""."
574,"This show is amazing, I've read the books and even knowing what's coming it STILL sticks with you (it's been over a month at this point and I find myself still thinking of S4E08) and that's the mark of a great story. Just be warned it's a very harsh story and not for anyone who's squeamish. The characterization is very deep and there are not really any one note 'good' or 'evil' characters just people dealing with life in a brutal, violent world. Peter Dinklage stands out from the start as he put's on a master class of a performance as Tyrion Lannister, he's an absolute joy to watch.If you decide to take this journey just keep the title of this review in mind. Valar Morghulis."
575,"Before I watched this series I had already heard great things from friends and co workers. I already had HBO so I hopped onto HBO go one night and watched the first couple episodes. It was definitely interesting so I kept going. Once you get to the middle of season 1 you will be hooked! I had a marathon and watched the rest of season 1 and season 2 in just a couple days! Loved it!

If you like drama you'll like this series. If you like action you'll like this series. If you like fantasy you'll like this series.

The show is epic and I can't wait until season 3 comes out! Season 3 releases March 2013!"
576,"loyalty for novel, spectacular show, magnificent adaptation of each detail. sure, not a real surprise for HBO but it is a major success to create an entire world in so manner. the key - perfect cast and power of images. the freedom for each step of tale and mixture of seduction and cold view. exercise of masterpiece, it is more than adaptation. the colors are part of nuances. the dialog is seed of events. the territories - pieces of huge puzzle - are slices of tasty bread. the force of measure is the rule, secret and miracle to make this extraordinary work. no drop of speculation, only ash honey of a monumental river of survive."
577,"Well, I could not watch the series along with my family, but the whole series is just amazing. The setup, the script, the actors were absolutely perfect.

I was a little low-optimistic at the start of the series, but as it went on with the kind of blood, violence and nudity, it kept impressing me.

I'd watched every episode with my favorite snacks and a can of Pepsi. According to me, this series is a must watch for those who love fictional drama.

I was planning on reading the book series but now I'd just wait for the new episodes and seasons for next seven years. Thank you director and producer for making this series. All the best."
578,"This series is clear evidence that a top production does not necessarily mean a good product. It is too notorious, but under all that thrown money has almost nothing. Except of course loads of nudity and perversion for the younger generation. Without nudity this series would be a fiasco because the main plot is a combination of Santa Barbara and The Hobbit, and Dynasty, with an emphasis on Dynasty (in the Middle Ages). HBO with this series pushes the boundaries and approaching pornography, but it is obvious that sexual perversion, blood and violence is for today's generations everything in life. Too bad, if producers used a bit more RR's book and reduce these annoying dialogs, we would get a lot more dynamic, better product."
579,"9.4 is just a much overrated point for this show.What kind of pleasure did you get from this?This is just not right when you compare this show to other great shows..!

It just shows kingdoms simultaneously and goes on like ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" in middle age.No action, no excitement until Season 2- Episode 5...!!!

Please be a bit objective about this show.Those who adore ""Game of Thrones""because of the next possible episodes, do not give the people who has still not watched it, the wrong idea.

That is all I want to say!"
580,"Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard of GoT.

My 2 cents?

It's good. Very good. But also very over rated.

Watch. Enjoy. Experience. Buy don't buy into the hype."
581,"I realize I'm part of a painfully small minority, but nevertheless, here goes. I only managed to get through the first season and even that took a lot of energy. I love fantasy as a genre, so it's not like I started out with preconceptions, but the initial exhilaration turned quickly into disappointment once I realized the whole series was based on a very simple structure: 90% of each episode sees two people, sometimes three or more, in a room, a hall, a hut or in a garden, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking.... and then talking some more, mainly about past deeds and dead rulers. And the whole concoction is made so much more arduous to watch by the amateurish direction, which relies on the ""artistic"" choice of showing a close up of the speaking character, then switching to a close up of the next character talking, then back once more, over and over again. Every now and then there a horseback ride and sometimes, all too seldom I might add, there's a brief sword fight. That's it - that's the big show everybody's so giddy about. I don't get it."
582,"What in the beginning has been a promising TV-show, with a rich story behind rich visuals became a feast of killing, perversions, ever so thinner story and predictable outcome. The producers obviously try to squeeze the last drop of milk from an exhausted cow. After killing so many characters, new emerge but without any reason or cause except transforming GOT into another Lost. Instead of answers, we got more questions. Instead of coherent storyline, we got thousands of branches with no leaves and no ending in sight. I've watched all episodes at once, one after another, and it was still gets harder to follow. I could not imagine how it would be week after week. Nothing to remember, nothing to link with anything. This is not a fantasy story any more, but randomly picturing someone's dirty mind/dreams in a form of a TV-show. However, the acting and direction (in such circumstances) is superb, although the characters are pretty one-dimensional (either good or bad) with no depth. If you endured so far, keep watching and hoping for better story development. If you did not watch any of GOT so far, don't bother. Read the books."
583,"Game of Thrones is well made and has excellent acting. However there are a ridiculous amount of characters, each with their own mission and agendas. You might be able to get the gist by reading accompanying wikis and utilising the rewind button but you really have to pay attention. This is not an easy watch. I stuck with it for a good two seasons and concentrated really hard.

I often enjoy fantasy films but not big on historical themes unless there is an excellent storyline or humour in there. This may have affected my opinion of this series. They talk a lot throughout the film. There is action but it can get confusing figuring out why people are hacking each other to pieces again. I just wish there was less strategising and more dragons."
584,"After four episodes, I have to say that I am disappointed. It's not that too much is happening - I love my entertainment to be packed with storytelling - it's more that every single thing that happens, and the way everything is done, is utterly cliché, and seems cobbled together from dozens of other works. The impetus of the story is shock value and soap opera, sex scenes that convey obviously conservative values (as per what we're supposed to be shocked about), characters who act idiotically, and stupid-looking hair-colors. This does not say ""timeless quality"" to me.

There is some entertainment value here, but not enough to make it really interesting. The show has two assets: Peter Dinklage and Maisie Williams. Well, and Sean Bean. And, I guess, the guy who plays the bastard, although he, too, is terribly cliché. Oooh, the wronged bastard who is really a super-nice guy and worthy heir... sheesh. Anyway, I felt like I recognized Maisie Williams from somewhere, but it dawned on me that she just resembles James McAvoy quite enormously... Funny.

Anyway, I don't expect this show to keep my (very critical, I admit) interest for much longer, as it will probably never rise from its swamp of soapiness and into truly epic territory. I will say, though, that I'm impressed and amused with the way HBO always makes use of almost exclusively British acting talent when they want to make sure the cast and the voice acting are of a properly excellent caliber. Cheaper and better in one fell swoop, no doubt. So, I guess the U.S. still needs the ol' country now and again when quality is at the stake...

6 stars out of 10."
585,"I thought for once there would have been a medieval series that my kids could watch, but to no avail, this one is on the banned list for my household. Why does it seem every series ""needs"" sex? And not just normal, hidden sex, but graphic, and nothing any person under the age of 18 should ever see. For this reason, and for the reason they add so much extra the books don't have, so you think they can leave the graphic nudity of ONLY WOMEN out. Yes, I said it, this is another series targeting only showing women's nudity. Granted it's not the plot, but there is too much for a normal couple, or family to enjoy. I know of series' that can leave out the graphic nudity, but still get amazing reviews. I am a family mom, nothing containing nudity or drugs enters my house without me knowing. This will turn into another Camelot, plot and story line say one thing, but it's the graphic sexual nature that will end up getting the show taken off air. Edit: For anyone who didn't like this series there are a few IMDb users who take it upon themselves to harass anyone who didn't like it. They try to Make you mad by assuming personal details that are completely false. And these people call themselves adults, they are nothing more than children trying to get a boner. I stand by my word that this is a HORRIBLE series. This is MY opinion, that should concern No one else. If anyone else gets these harassing/threatening messages, simply ignore these kids. All they want is the satisfaction of making you mad, I have 3 kids; these immature toddlers are NOTHING compared to any mom raising kids. We have patience that will last a lifetime."
586,"The first season is excellent, astonishing, considering how ordinary the literary source is. I was excited. The second season has been cruelly disappointing. I have spared myself the following seasons."
587,I'm glad there's a fast forward button on my video player. Series started out interesting and slipped into dull dross
588,"Game of thrones combine a lot of drama with epicity, the story is very intense but they do not forget take time to to get congruence events. This has the most shocking and well-justified plot twists I've seen, besides well-crafted characters that make the story simply unforgettable, it's not predictable at all, nobody knows how game of thrones will end until we're watching it on screen.Art of televison,wonderful."
589,Game of Thrones is a masterfully crafted show with a sprawling cast and beautiful cinematography. The scope of this show is magnificent. The acting is exceptionally well and the story truly riveting. The show is packed with memorable characters and moments. Truly one of the finest shows to ever grace the silver screen.
590,Its good. That is all i have to say about it. Ignore this im just trying to make it longer.
591,"There is no word to describe this show. It has mystery, drama, adventure, action, fantasy, politics etc.. all in one entertainment."
592,"Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong?

The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.

Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.

One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.

It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.

Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.

Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.

'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).

In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
593,"Game of thrones is certainly not a show for the light-hearted. As most know, this show is based on a series of books and this review is for those who haven't read them. What make this show the third highest rated TV show of all time on IMDb are numerous reasons: the plot for instance, is heavy on mystery, interconnections between various characters and massively impactful character development. Despite being something like a medieval fantasy, this show has characters going through conflicts that can be seen in the real world, in this era- the stigma faced by people with physical disabilities, being painted falsely because your opinions don't match with those of the popular, learning that trust is a very fragile thing...and the like. It is very hard to write a review without spoilers for a show with such an extensive and engaging plot. It does contain scenes of heavy violence and nudity (albeit as the seasons progress, the nudity decreases and violence increases) but unlike the misconception of many- ""Oh, that show is only watched so much for its obscene scenes""- the show is so, so much more. With excellent cinematography, characters who will morally affect your own thinking, unforgettable lines and themes- Game of Thrones is a treat for those who are smart and mature enough to get exactly what the show tries to convey. It may not appeal to some, however, mainly because its story is vast and contains numerous characters- it will be hard to follow, but totally worth it if your mind's sharp enough!"
594,"The production scale,the sets, everything is so huge for a TV show and is becoming comparable to any multi million dollar Hollywood movie. At first I thought of would be an ordinary fantasy series with some adult scenes forcefully pushed into it. But later on I started liking the plot twists ,the unexpected killings, the war scenes etc. The series is addictive and this is why it has gone on to become the most watched TV series in the world. The series is not for the faint hearted though as it contain many violent and torturing scenes.But overall it is more than fun to watch and keeps you guessing what is going to happen in upcoming episodes"
595,"The HBO masterpiece, Game of Thrones, is truly one of the greatest shows that has ever been created. Set in the fantasy world of Westeros, GOT presents audiences with a very mature and unpredictable story about war, politics, family, and death.

-PROS: The story of this show is best of any show that I've seen. The main plot is intense, interesting, and ever evolving. The show features many great and memorable characters (some you will love, and rest you will hate). The lives and deaths of many of the characters are very emotional and deep. The show is incredibly unpredictable, with many unexpected twists and turns. GOT makes excellent use of its HBO budget, featuring set pieces and CG that rival many Hollywood movies. The cinematography is absolute excellent and visually appealing. Acting is fantastic and the show paces very well. You do not need to have read the books or be a fantasy nerd to enjoy this amazing series. The amazing story, great characters, and beautiful cinematography make this one of the greatest shows ever created.

-CONS: This series is not for the faint of heart, as it contains brutal violence and graphic nudity. I wouldn't recommend this show to anybody under the age of 18 as it is an adult oriented show. This is not really a bad thing, but it does put restrictions on those who can watch it. The show contains no significant flaws other than the occasional slow episode (which is expected from time to time).

I would give a GOT a solid 10/10 as it is indeed a masterpiece that all TV watchers should watch, regardless of what genre they prefer."
596,"The storyline feels like something you need a Wikipedia page to follow. It's the stuff of fantasy geek heaven, i.e.a strongly gritty period drama with letter-perfect clothes, weapons and lingo, yet unencumbered by historical facts or the weight of real events. Of all the sword- flinging series which are on TV right now, Game of Thrones is by far the best – cloaking a clever commentary on modern day political conniving with a gray Medieval-age story which feels like Rings' older, sexed-up brother. The main accomplishment of Game of Thrones is in that, while it should keep the hard-core fans satisfied, even viewers who don't care if Theon is a Greyjoy or a Tully can have a good time."
597,"After watching the first 4 seasons I've decided to give GOT 9 stars. But for all the unnecessary and awkward nudity, I'm talking away one star.

GOT is about the iron throne of the 7 kingdoms. And people who are trying to control get comfortable on the iron throne. So they wage wars, people die. ""King""s fall. Noble families decays. And all these unfortunate incidents are originated from ""incest"".

This show is all about tragedy. It preys on your addiction to sadness. Without tragedy, it would have not been a great success. But they could at least make the death scenes more emotional. I mean when I watched the show with my brother, we both laughed during the death scenes. So come on be more serious.

The show is shot in 4-5 different European countries. And all of them offers beautiful views. It's one of the great thing about the show. The beautiful soundtracks will make get yourself lost inside the TV.

The cast of GOT is very large and quite powerful. Beside they need new casting members each season because a significant number of characters die each season.

The show offers a great deal of violence and gore, which is acceptable for a show set in medieval time. But they really don't need to show these much nudity. I don't want to watch porn.

GOT had the stuffs that makes a ""Best TV Show of all time"". It still has. But unless they stop playing it safe GOT won't reach it's full potential."
598,"The sheer size of the cast and the way in which the show manages them, by providing ample time for each and every single one of them in itself is a master-piece. Coupled with an amazing plot and some fantastic dialogues this truly is the best in TV as of now.

The ""Computer Generated Imagery"" in the show is almost perfect.

Locations are perfectly chosen and are apt for the various situations that arise in the show.

It also has a good mix of Action, Drama and Fantasy.

As for as the deviations from the book is concerned, I don't know anything as I haven't read them..."
599,"This is the best show HBO have produced by far. Unlike most shows, this one have been kept sincere to the books. No major events changes have been made, only some details. And that's what makes this show wonderful. Also, the acting is terrific and the actors have been chosen perfectly along with the locations, dressing, decor... Even Those who have read the books and know what is going to happen, still experienced excitement and thrill through the watch. Speaking of myself, what got me hooked to the show is the character of Daenerys Targaryen, probably the most empowering female fictional character of all time. Emilia Clarke have done a fantastic job with her. The rest of the characters which are multiple and very different are as interesting too."
600,"I just started watching the series what a week back (4/14/2012) may be, so I got to see he the complete season 1 and I loved it.

I like movies/TV series which are multi plotted and if you add the medieval touch that is a classic and that is what Game of Thrones is.

I am not an big fan of TV series but this is one of the few I have watched and loved others being Rome, Prison Break, American Horror Story & The Walking dead.

The Game of Thrones has very good characters and good actors for those characters, none of them are what they seem. The Game of Thrones is about struggle of power and what men/women can do get power.

I would Strongly recommend this TV Series from HBO."
601,"Simply the best show I have ever watched. I am also a skeptic and quick to point out flaws and Hollywood Exaggerations. I cannot even put into words how good this series is. It has reinvented cinema for me. I generally only watch BBC and National geographic, etc as I cannot tolerate most of the rubbish on TV. I SINCERELY HOPE THEY MAKE SO MANY SEASONS OF G>O>T that the polar ice caps will completely melt before they take this off the air... I have recommended this show to all my friends at work and outside of work. Every single one of them are hooked and cannot stop watching. So a million teabags for Game of Thrones and everyone who helped put it together. You are the best thing that has happened in my life since Particle Physics. Mrs. Targaryen Will you marry me?"
602,"Game of Thrones is, quite simply, one of the best series I have ever watched.

Right up there with The X Files, Battlestar, West Wing, 24, I just love it.

Well acted, brilliantly written, sets that wouldn't look out of place in a movie blockbuster and story lines and characters to die for.

Every episode is like a mini movie, as series one goes on it just gets better and better. Cleverly they have avoided any huge battle scenes - I presume they are coming in series 2.

Amazing shocks along the way and one of the best final shots to a series ever, everything is perfectly poised for an epic season 2.

Can't wait!"
603,"I read the books and was very much looking forward to this show. Counting the days almost!

Unfortunately, like some other reviewers here, I was sorely disappointed. There are a few reasons for this. The opening scene in the woods looked very good, but the rest of the show looked to me a lot less beautiful. Sometimes it even looked like people were standing in front of a screen with scenery.

Next, the level of acting. Some actors were very good, others were dreadful. Just reciting lines with absolutely no feeling or emotion. But maybe that is not entirely their fault. It could be because they tried to put way too much into 1 episode. Why not start with introducing one house? Get to know the characters, give the viewers some feeling about who they are. This all felt very rushed, and especially if you haven't read the books, I can imagine you have no idea who is who. Even after reading the books, I felt absolutely no connection to the characters.

Finally, the nudity.. I don't mind nudity if it is presented right and where you expect it. For example, in the series Rome, I never had this problem. But here it just felt sometimes like: ""just put some naked women on the screen (or sex scenes) because that is what people like to see"". Well, it didn't work for me.

Hopefully the next episode will be a lot better. I have to give this show another chance, because I LOVE the books. Let's all hope the next one isn't as rushed as the pilot."
604,"As if there weren't enough characters after the first 3 episodes, they add more. I know the series is just staying loyal to book. But the writers just crammed too many events in this episode. It's difficult to follow for anyone who hasn't read the book. What's more, a lot of those events are only back stories which are not shown, only talked about by characters? ""Show; don't tell"" is a basic principle of good writing. Moreover, in a 50 or so minute espidode, how necessary is 2 minutes of two men talking/reminiscing about a battle where they fought side by side? There are several scenes like this in this episode. The editing is bad, as well. The scene where Daenerys kicks Viserys' ass (or they have an argument just outside the horse lords' domain) is immediately followed by Viserys in bed with a pleasure giver. I found a lot of flaws in this episode that I can't even remember all of them."
605,"I literally just finished reading the book and loved every word! I cannot express how disappointed I am by the series. The acting is perfunctory, some of the locations are not at all correct and I really don;t understand why they had to play around with the dialogues so much!! You have an amazing book there which gives you everything you need and instead it has become a tapestry of scenes which don;t flow and do not convey any of the history or the background. Some characters like Varys and Petyr Baelish really lack that venomous, conniving (is that spelled correctly??) edge to them..same goes for Cercei. I find Khal Drogo very disappointing..I would have expected a far larger and more robust man..and where are the bells??? intricate part of him and totally lacking..as well as the grassy plains and the whole 'important moments in a man's life should be done under the stars'. It's a shame.

I would have thought a series rather than a movie would be the ideal carrier for such an amazing book but even though I have tried to watch it several times and come back to it several times, I am always disappointed."
606,"I am up to the red wedding, so anyone past that is very safe from any possible spoilers. There should not be any, but better safe than sorry.

Sure the production values are good, and so is the acting. But all I get out of this show, is the fact that good people are fuc^ed over and or slaughtered, and the evil people win. All i get out of this show is the fact that a piece of shi^ queen, and her insane inbread son the king, get away with all types of barbaric behavior, for years. I watch a show to see some good, some retribution, not babies and innocents being tortured and or must plain murdered. I am on a marathon, and am up to the red wedding. May be in season 20 there will be someone to root for. Soneone to avenge all the evil and brutality. Or is this evil and brutality what draws people to this show.?

I like good winning but I do not want to wait 10 years.."
607,"They're really milking the series — a lot of filler has extended a story that could've been told in completion with a few 8 episode seasons.

Season 6 is really pushing things — my biggest issue with it is waking up and having to find the point in an episode where I fell asleep. That, and killing a major character in a season finale for dramatic effect, and then bringing him or her back to life -- lazy storytelling. AmbienTV...

The subtitled scenes are a bit pretentious, either give me an entire foreign language series with subtitles, or give me spoken English — especially now as Game of Thrones season 6 has achieved that level of TV where you can let it run in the background and just zone in on the good parts :-("
608,"I have never written an IMDb review before. I find myself needing to because I am pretty enamored by the start of this series and I know there are many other nerds like me who will love it, just waiting to know if the show is worthy of a watch...IT IS!!! First off, I just got done re-reading the series in anticipation of the release of the newest book which is due out this summer. So, for the last couple weeks I have done little more than read these four huge books. When someone asks me who my favorite author is I tell them George RR Martin, because of this series. The books bring an entire world to life, if you haven't' read them, I recommend highly that you do. That being said, this adaptation seems to be very well done, so far (I have only watched the first episode, though). First, I want to note that I HATE watching a bad version of a good book! Likewise, I hate watching a copy that tries to be a doppelganger of the book (thinking of the Twilight movies here). What I look for is someone to bring the characters to life, and show me more. Whether more something is additional to the story that I read, or only a better depth depends on the movies' production crew, I suppose. For me, thus far, I have enjoyed HBO's interpretation of the faces of the characters and I have seen the storyline followed pretty well, without it being so exact that it just reminded me why reading the story is usually the better option. Bottom line: a good start for a great story! If you, like me, find yourself wanting to see more subscribe to HBO and let them know that you want them to continue with this storyline. THANK YOU HBO for doing such a great job creating visual version of my well loved story (and many thanks to Mr. Martin for writing it, and finally publishing the continuation). Buy the book and watch the show!"
609,"I cant write more lines to explain about this great series. I was addicted by Harry Potter in my childhood to watch crazily entire all parts, I love that so much imagined so many times in real life. when comes young age I saw Lord of the Rings, a superb movie after longtime. But Game of Thrones is very different every episode touched my heart and mind blown always. Ever best made Series in Hollywood, i gave 10 rating may be it is low also in my opinion. All the characters wow such great creation to shows on the screen its not a simple or difficult, its look like a guy life aim to create such movie or series in his entire career. The best effort put inside and out come is not best more than this words. Every Character i loved waiting for Season 8 and more curious waiting how to finish the finale season by director judgement.

Game of Thrones I have addicted in young age for this series. Ever Created the Best TV Series in the world. 10/10 is very less to this series. I have no other option"
610,"First, I'm not saying anything about the storyline, because if I even give a hint about one episode, it'll ruin the whole seasons experience, and no one would like that, because the show is just excellent.

Game of Thrones. The most brilliant, hard to watch, raw and brutal show ever to be released on television. I don't get into TV shows that much, but from the time I even heard the name ""Game of Thrones"", I knew it'd be amazing, because HBO just does an amazing job with shows.

This show doesn't hold anything back, sex and violence play a huge part in this masterpiece. The sheer, unflinching brutality of this show brought back a feeling which I only had when I watched Wolf Creek for the first time!

If you enjoyed the books, the show is even better. People say that Breaking Bad would have to be the best show on TV, well they musn't have watched Game of Thrones, because all elements that one would look for in a show is here. Violence, a deep storyline and much more!

Speaking of which, time to re-watch season 1!"
611,"Game of Thrones is a beginning of an epic journey of series. A story that brings back good old memories. Drama, war, magic and epic conversations. I am referring to lord of the rings movies. Game of thrones is still not the same, it's something new of it kinds with it's own touch.

I love it and it hurts to meet people who haven't open their eyes for Game of thrones.

I am not a professional reviewer. This is my personal experience and I m not here to sell it, I share if for those who read these review. Because you don't want to miss the ""epicness"" of Game of Thrones. I give it a 10/10.

P.S. Not a big fan of shivers? Then don't watch it..."
612,"Watch it and convince yourself! You can find in it everything, all genres, all kinds of scenes, characters, just everything."
613,One of the best shows on tv! Can't wait to see how it ends.
614,It's amazing. Cinematography. Acting. Just....all of it. Beautiful. Had me in tears a few times. I'm loving it.
615,What an amazing series. Only negative is that it'll come to an end.
616,"Game of Thrones is a story unlike any other. With the masterful brush of its cast and crew, the show paints life in many, many aspects with a sweet philosophical layer under the original and authentic mediaval story. It is a deeply human, although disturbing, experience, making you side with characters you hated a few episodes before. It always uses a mix of black and white to get you thinking without reaching a definite answer, leaving the interpretation of the characters' acrions to yourself. And, it lures you with a scent of unpredictableness I had never seen before, which its narrative emanates at all times. A true masterpiece, I believe GoT is must for admirers of art in all of its forms."
617,"I have been coming to IMDB for 4 years and just never thought to write a review about any show or movie. I thought to myself since Game of Thrones is in its final season,I had to write something. Not since ""The sopranos "" have I ever seen such perfection in television,HBO and David benioff and David Nuttier take George R.R. Martins epic fantasy of drama and suspense and deliver perfection in ""Game Of Thrones""....I strongly urge you if you have been living in a cave or just have not had the privilege of watching Game Of Thrones..I strongly strongly believe you should find the time in binging the seven seasons of excellence that lead up to the final six episodes of Game Of Thrones...in one word I give this show is utter ""genius"". No show in my mind besides ""The Sopranos"" could live up to hands down the greatest show EVER!!! GAME OF THRONES!!! To all the other Throne family,we shall endure the final six episodes starting April 14th,as I watch the trailer,I become immersed in the elequantly adaption of perfection...I know I keep saying it but it truly is! Enjoy everyone,as ""Game Of Thrones"" is finally upon us it comes as bittersweet knowing it will end...but like ""Cersei"" says ""when you play the Game Of Thrones there is no middle ground you win or you die. EPIC!! ,PERFECTION!!"
618,"Well i have never ever thought that a movie or a tv show would really deserve a 10 star but , if you have to do it once absolutely it gonna be Game of thrones cuZ it just come one in life it maybe have its you know like some bad hits but absolutely the love for the show and how we belive it make us accept it very well , its a masterpiece its an true art."
619,"The best show ever made! It has it all.. adventures, war, Politics, Romance, Mind Games, Amazingly acted.. and Scenes and story is mind boggling."
620,"Well it's obvious that Game of thrones has been the most loved show of all time. The most fascinating thing about this show is that they all makes perfect sense. From directing to acting and VFX (Mind blowing) to music all are just perfect. I had heard the name of Game of Thrones but never wanted to watch it as my thoughts were that there would be some men or families fighting for a throne so that they would rule the world. That was my thought for game of thrones. But one day my cousin asked me that have you seen game of thrones ? I said no and i dont wanna. And after watching it you are going to thank me for suggesting it. I said alright if you are saying so i will give it a try. And after i watched season 1, i was like woah! And then my marathon begun. Within 5 days i completed season 7 And just after completing it i texted my cousin and thanked him 😁 That's the dominance of Game of Thrones. It will make you fall in love with it untill you get bored with it. Just one thing more if you haven't watched it yet go for it without getting spoiled by reading or finding things about game of thrones."
621,No much talking there. It is AMAZING AMAZING AND AMAZING.
622,"Fantastic tv show, much money invested in every episode"
623,I really love to write that GOT is one of the best web series in the world.
624,"I truly experienced something deeply engrossing, highly emotional, filled with dark plot twists, fantastic visuals, and storytelling of epic proportions."
625,"First thing I think you have to understand is that THIS IS NOT EARTH being portrayed here! You can't say ""it was like that back then"" or compare it to the morals of earth human beings. It is utter fantasy and that is why you need an open mind to truly enjoy this series. It stretches your imagination, your limits of morals and right and wrong. That is the fantastic part about this series! In order to truly enjoy it you need to put your mind in the mind of each character and allow yourself to BE a part of the show. Then you can really get hooked into the show! Then you can watch and enjoy each moment and episode by episode you will get pulled in deeper till you are biting your nails down to nubs till the next episode/season. When that happens, THEN you know beyond a shadow of a doubt...you are watching Fantasy as Fantasy SHOULD be watched! All hail to the Throne...and whoever deserves to be sitting on it in the end!"
626,"This is so easily my number 1 series. The characters are perfect, the story, the dragons the twists. Everything is on point, well done. Absolutely magnificent!"
627,I didnt watch this till the beginning of season 6 but boy i made a mistake. I watched this show 4 times now and i read all the books. This show is the gamechanger.
628,Awaiting for the final season.The best show ever. You surely can connect all the dots of these characters and storyline from season 1. The plots are so much connected. Very rare to find such minute details where it still connect to season 1. Kudos to the entire team and thanks for making this blockbuster. Waiting for new projects from this producer duos. 😊👍
629,Are usually don't even watch TV and I downloaded HBO now and I paid for a subscription because I had heard that Game of Thrones was so good so I started watching it and I binged from season one to season seven it is the best show I've ever watched. I've never had a TV show draw me in and keep my attention for so long awesome awesome awesome .
630,"All time favorite.The best yet.the directing,acting,story,visual effects. Everything is perfect."
631,"The series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has stated that ""the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves."
632,"This show is just so epic, the best one that has ever aired! The plot twists, the character developements, the mind-blowing, shocking, amazing moments,... I totally recommend it for you 10/10 you should watch it as soon as possible."
633,"No TV series or movies can be compared to GoT.

In many BS movies/shows you can predict the ending after watching it for a few minutes (good ones always win and the bad ones seem to be completely retarded, blind, and incompetent. Well, not anymore!!!

The story in GoT is absolutely amazing, filled with interesting and ""realistic"" plot twists and unexpected events."
634,"I didn't see such a build up series like that , The writing is incredible, Acting, directing, CGI, the story is deep ,and the parallels .every thing is on point."
635,Must watch. Fantasy never seemed so real. With the very first episode it will get you hooked
636,"There is a common stereotype which goes with tv shows pertaining to ancient times, having dragons and warriors. They are supposed to be monotonous with the general public. I too had my speculations and following the trend never really watched these kinds of shows.

Game of Thrones - a fantasy drama series, set in an early landscape of England, where people waged war for a throne, was no different to me. It had kings wearing oversized rugs, their queens glistening in golden gowns and the ever so obedient daughters, the sons - playing and practicing with swords: the first episode seemed like a direct inference to the stereotype we discussed before. It wasn't to be though, and somehow I continued.

Game of Thrones is an experience which I feel everyone should be a part of. It crosses boundaries of suspense in a way you can never imagine, it gives you endings worse than goosebumps, there are fiery speeches, immaculate acting, perfect direction and possibly one of the best stories you will ever come across. The show runs on the idea of anything can happen in a very literal sense. And that is not an easy feat.

It's something I'd recommend to any person, irrespective of their age or gender. Must watch!"
637,The scenes are portrayed in thes best manner. The performance by the cast is stunning. My favorite character lord tyrion
638,"This show is a very very interesting. The plot will just blow your mind. At first i felt this show has too many characters but later understood that each and every character has a very crucial role in the show. Till now i dint find any other show greater than this. Positive : each and every episode has a lot more to do with story. A very strong plot. Extremely good cast and direction. Negative : dint find any except, can't be watched with family"
639,Too good. Outstanding. Enough said. Go watch it Idiot if you have not it yet
640,"I mean come on... I think I don't need to say how good Game of Thrones is. But DAMM this series is just incredibly good! I actually didn't read the books first. I have to say that when I saw the pilot I was a little bit sceptical about the series. I thought it was another one of those medieval series. But it didn't take me very long to realize that this series was different. First of all the quality of the series (music, filming, acting..) is really incredible, which is actually quite understandable when yu see their budget. One thing I really love on the series are the accents and the languages. They make the serie so enjoyable to watch and also ( now that I read the books) I can say that the way they talk is pretty similar to the books. Since I'm talking about the books: many series that are based on books are never as great as the original story and are critisized for cutting out a lot of important things and not keeping the same athmosphere. But I have to say that the producers did an amazing job on not disappointing the bookfans. The book and the series are equally good in my opinion. To end this I also wanted to point out how unpredictable GoT is. I think thats also what makes it so great and why we are al still thrilled after 7 seasons. In most Tv shows you can easily predict what happens but in GoT you rarely know who's going to survive the next episode. At least after the red wedding you realize you can't be attached to your favorite characters for too long... because you never know when they might die...! Can't wait for season 8 to come out!!!"
641,"They have taken great books and did not fail converting it into an amazing TV show, one of the best ever. The world design is amazing, the atmosphere, the characters, the dialogues, it all looks so good and real. There's no doubt that they have filmed an awesome show, but still, what makes it so different, what makes it so special that it turned into the hit it is?

For me, It's basically the progression of the story. I did not read the books but since the show is based on the books, I can say they have chosen the right books to turn into a show. The story is constantly progressing, you will never feel that an episode has ended but the world has not changed. There's always something happening, everything has a meaning. This is quite rare because books are usually turned into movies. The TV shows are usually quite dull and once they are done with the character and story building, the main plot becomes repetitive and boring, which isn't the case here. Additionally, In GOT it's not just 1 plot. It's multiple connected events happening in different places in the world. In modern TV shows you usually get to know just one side, usually the ""good side"". in GOT there's no such thing. You get to know all the sides involved and you never know what's going to happen, who's going to die and who's not.

That's how they keep you ""hooked"". There's so much happening, different events in different camps. You will always wonder what's going to happen and how one event in one camp affect all the other things happening around the world.

But it all leads me to the main problem that I had with the story. I finished all 7 seasons, and yes, it was interesting. I was constantly hooked, but I never felt satisfied. It's like i spent 7 season waiting for something, expecting something that has never happened. Some main events such as big battles that I wanted to see, never really happened because the heroes died or it will happen only in season 8. Some of the battles that we have seen, did not really meet my expectations. And all those ""plot twists"" are usually one ally betraying another. It happens so often that I got used to it quickly enough. From there it was hard for me to really call anything a ""plot twist"" when it's expected and already part of the show. The show is basically about sex, death and betrayals.

Any way, they did something really great here. I wish we could see more shows like this and stories which are taken from talented book writers, because I can't stand the banal scripts of most TV shows those days."
642,"This is the best thing I've ever seen on television. ""Game of Thrones"" has stunning super special effects, great storylines, complex characters, many things to wonder about, magic, mystery, fantasy. It's otherworldly but I almost wish I could go there and visit places in Westeros and Essos. It's got a realistic feel about it, more than any other fictional world. It's more vivid than Dr Who and Tolkien's Middle Earth. It's better than Star Trek and I was always a trekkie. It's right up my alley. It's got dragons too! The battles are epic and the actors are so good. I've been reading the books that the series is based on and I understand it isn't possible to include everything but that doesn't matter. This isn't just TV but its art and a masterpiece."
643,"Amazing soundtrack, amazing acting, amazing directing. Just an overall amazing work of art. The best you'll see."
644,"Season 1 is a little bit confusing, 7 out of 10, seasons 2-4 10 stars, season 5 is nonsense, 4 out of 10, seasons 6 and 7 - 7 stars. I would not recommend to watch this show until it's all finished. If they do a good ending I'll give it 9 stars out of 10. If they fail to give us a reasonable ending - 5 out of 10. The average is about 7.5 right now.

The production values are awesome, acting is good - the story in seasons 1-4 is interesting but a little bit protracted. The quality of writing in seasons 5-7 is slightly below average."
645,"In single words... the best series í have seen ever, since first season you are involved and obligate to continue submerging you in game of thrones World. Simply amazing TV show.. To people who haven't seen yet, you have to take a piece of this, you will not regret it! ... Also í want to congratulate all the game of thrones Team who made this possible..."
646,"Firstly I love GOT and this WAS without doubt the best thing I've seen on TV but looks like the original creator of this don't seem to care enough about the true fans of this show who made it so popular and now are laying out every forced and fan theory they found on the internet instead of creatively sitting down and coming up with a great script that were found on the first four seasons. Well we cant fully blame them too since there is no GRRM source to adapt from anymore but the least they could do is not try to take the audience as fools who will eat anything up but sadly it is just what they are doing. So much to point that I don't care about the final season anymore which I never in a million years would have thought could have happened to the great show that was Game of Thrones. I am now just waiting for GRRM books. Show runners must really be deluded if they think their new show would barely be a hit by saying a big ""f**k you"" to the fans who gave them a successful platform for their own vision."
647,"I liked Season 1 of ""Game of Thrones;"" I really did. I don't yet love the show in the same way that so many other people do, however, and I'd honestly rate this 10-episode season an 8 out of 10. If that sounds like faint praise for a show that seems universally loved, I concede that my criticisms really reflect my own personal tastes, not to mention my admittedly narrow attention span.

It's an undeniably well made show, in terms of everything from acting to set design. Its densely plotted story (with so many characters!) suggests to me that it is probably true to George R. R. Martin's books, which I have not read. The show seems like an authentic adaptation that respects the viewer's intelligence and consequently demands a lot of him or her.

There is a lot to admire, such as the show's attention to a myriad of details in order to meticulously render Martin's fantasy universe. Peter Dinklage is consistently wonderful to watch as Tyrion Lannister. Aidan Gillen and Conleth Hill are both downright Shakespearian as Littlefinger and Varys, the two duplicitous members of the Court at King's Landing. Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) and Iain Glen (Jorah Mormont) are also all favorites of mine. (Glen is none other than the ""Resident Evil"" films' original Wesker! And he has such a damn cool voice.)

The script, direction and production values all usually seem quite good. The show even has moments of brilliance -- the first episode's opening teaser, in which we witness an attack on the border wall by the icy ""White Walker"" monsters, was scarier than a hell of a lot of horror movies I've seen.

Which brings us to my frustrations, and, yes, they are mostly subjective. I actually did bring certain appetites as an audience member that weren't met. I craved more action, and greater emotional payoff for the dialogue-heavy story arcs that built tension throughout the first season. (Caveat: I am a fan of both horror movies and war films, and I suspect I'm not exactly the target audience for what is essentially a political thriller in a fantasy context.)

The inaugural episode's White Walkers were what I was dying to see the most. And I do think they should have been featured more prominently, from a storytelling perspective. Otherwise they shouldn't have served as the teaser-opener for the entire season. Nor should they have been the plot driver for the story lines connected with the Wall and The Night's Watch.

We also see extensive preparations for war, and military maneuvering -- we even have important scenes taking place at troop encampments. But there is absolutely no climax for these steadily building plot developments. I know I sound like a 13 year old, and maybe I am just not sophisticated enough to enjoy the show on its current levels, but I wanted see a battle. From a storytelling perspective, I suggest it's a bad creative decision to end the season without allowing us to truly witness a major land engagement. I do realize that we indeed see one house's brutal invasion of another's castle, and that it's well done. But it was too brief. Again, while ""Game of Thrones"" has all the trappings of a period war series, this is a political thriller in a fantasy context.

As for the Machiavellian politics, I am embarrassed to admit that I got lost early on. Yes, I'm fully aware that others are able to follow these plot threads quite easily. (My college chums can.) I'd just advise another viewer of average intelligence that their enjoyment might be affected by an unusually detailed story that requires their strict attention.

Finally, I do feel that there is a dearth of likable and identifiable characters. Nearly every major player is motivated by an ignoble goal (power). Many betray one another; that's the show's favorite plot point. Sean Bean's Eddard Stark is only a putative hero, to me. Yes, he's fighting for the rightful heir to the throne, but he's still serving a monarchy; he's not sticking up for the common man or anything. (We see loyalty among various characters to various noblemen, but nobody seems to care about the peasants.) Furthermore, Stark's actions toward a scared subordinate in the first episode made me unsympathetic to him. (I don't care who has vowed to do what -- his action in the series premier was unwarranted.)

Jon Snow is well scripted as a ""good"" character, but the actor portraying him needs to work on his range. Kit Harrington is decent in the role, but he too often looks like a sad, spurned poet. (Hey, it's okay, Snowman, I've been there myself.)

Daenerys Targaryen appears to be a ""good"" character, and I do like her. She's thinly rendered, though, despite what seems like an inordinate amount of screen time devoted to her major subplot. (And this subplot, with its legions of bare-chested barbarians, seems like a slowly paced cousin of the 1990's ""Xena: Warrior Princess."") Daenerys seems like an obvious power-fantasy for victimized women. (Yeah, I know there's nothing wrong with that. And, yeah, I know that people say something similar about my beloved comic book movies.)

With all of these criticisms, it may sound as though I didn't enjoy ""Game of Thrones."" To the contrary, I did. If you like fantasy and are looking for something well made and different, I'd recommend you try this. I think maybe I'm just trying to justify my more modest enthusiasm for one of contemporary pop culture's sacred cows."
648,"The TV series is one of the best i have seen in a long time. I have read all the books in the Fire and Ice Series and the TV series remains true to the books in most parts. Not disappointed one bit. My favorite character in the series is Tyrion Lannister and Peter Dinklage plays the character to the hilt. Me a little disappointed that George R R Martin does not belt out books as fast as i would want him to. But i guess it takes a lot of effort to come up with story of this magnitude and imagination. The story gets better as narrative continues. What is most fascinating about the story is the contrast in behaviour,attitude, morals of the different central characters example:Arya Stark and Sansa Stark.Nobody is good or bad they are just different shades of grey , some closer to white like Lord Eddard Stark and some closer to black like Jamie Lanister. Waiting/watching how HBO will out do itself in the next season."
649,Story line and acting is just Perfect. There Will Never be another Series like This.
650,"I've been watching GoT now yearly since it starts in 2011, every year I rewatch all episodes available and every time there are new things I missed on the previously viewed episodes. The show is well written, the actors are great, and everything else the crew did was amazing. I read all 5 books after watching the first season, it took me an entire Summer to go through all 5 (around 5000 pages) books, and I can tell that the creators of the show did an amazing job adapting the books to screen. Now, the show is caught up with the books, but I still find the storytelling from the writers of the show, incredibly interesting. I'm really sad that this is the last season, this show is the best show that I've ever watched, I love everything about it. I will continue to watch GoT every year even after the end. Job well done and congratulations to all the men and women who made this show such a success, first class crew and stars."
651,"Amazing story and top actors. The visual effects are the best ever seen. No compromise in the details, it is fantastic. Thanks to all the makers for high perfection and exited stories"
652,"Amamzing tv show, it is the show of the decade - what a plot, performances, itis incredible"
653,"This show is full of complex stories with highly developed characters and unpredictable events. George R. R. Martin has beautifully written a series that is as epic as it is poetic. He is always keeping us on our toes as we try to theorize what will happen next. The TV series is beautiful, breathtaking, and heartbreaking. The acting is fantastic, and the cinematography, costume design and make up is ridiculously high quality and detailed. There is light humour throughout the series which is perfectly placed.

If you STILL haven't started watching GOT, you are truly missing out. I have watched seasons 1 though 7 almost a dozen times now and each time, I better understand the people and the plots, and I uncover some information that I had not noticed before. This show has ruined TV for me, as I fear nothing will ever compare to it's greatness!"
654,"I don't understand those who have never seen this show. This is, without the shadow of a doubt, the greatest show of all time! This show transcends a t.v. show and actually creates an entire world that exists. Why anyone would willingly deprive themselves of this journey is beyond me, but if you are one of these people who thinks they have something to prove by not jumping on the band wagon, you need to wake up and get on! There is no doubt that this show will be revered and remembered as the best, throughout this lifetime and the next."
655,"People talk about a once in a lifetime event and I can assure you that this is one of them, this is the greatest show you will ever see. I took some convincing to initially watch, but 5 minutes in I was addicted, nearly as bad as my coffee addiction. If you havent watched your life is not completed, it's one for the bucket list."
656,"Brilliant, epic, breathtaking and awesome. The best fantasy series in the history of television."
657,Wow I have never seen a better show than that. You can never know what is waiting for you each episode.
658,Freaking love this show. Although a different from the actual books but still this show is the best of course after friends....
659,"I feel like Hawkeye should sit on the iron throne, if he was there against the night king different story!!!111!!! if the directors of GOT really know what is good for them they should bring hawkeye in the mix and if its too hard #bringbackkinggeoffrey."
660,"It's the greatest tv show In the whole galaxy. For me there is just no other TV show that can really compete with this franchise . It aces story telling, character development, twist, shocks, suspense, joy you name it. Can't believe I am reviewing this. If you have never watched the show it's a about time you do!"
661,"Top many words have been spent by reviewing this epic serie. However the best part Is the perfect mix of Joy, cruelty and hope. The empty feeling of seeing die the best characters who we have been used to love has been seen as a frustrating act by many but that's the key and It didn't accidentally happen"
662,Thanx r r Martin for this amazing books I hope he continues the other as fast as he can
663,"This IS the best Tv-series ever created. No question. I know some people don't like it that much (my parents included), but everyone who likes fantasy will love and respect this show so much.

The story is so complex and interesting, and doesn't have that one basically immortal hero that controls everything. Everyone can die in this show, and anything can happen. This makes it so interesting to watch.

This is a prime example of what a fantasy TV-show should look like"
664,"They always told me that this series was really good, and that I did not love any character. I did not believe them. This year I took the trouble to see it whole and I pass exactly what they told me."
665,"I do not understand how this series hasn't won more golden globes. It's beautifully written. Portraying the worst and best pieces of human behings. I've re watched the series and it's surprising how much more you pick up on. Cleverly, amazingly written!"
666,"Before watching this I heard everyone talking about game of thrones as a great series and whatever I didn't care about that at that time I thought it was very overrated and explicit series with lot of nudity and violence surrounding it. But when I finally watched the series i knew it was like no other series, the way it handled its characters and it has a perfect balance between good and evil is just awesome and I think everyone should watch this series. it is a special one so don't miss it."
667,"Good Story, Great Characters, Awesoe events.. What do we want more? 10/10 with no doubt."
668,One of the best TV series I have ever seen in my whole life. Waiting for new season.
669,You couldn't expect a better serial. It's perfect. I cant belive how good it is
670,"For so long I'd been hearing so much about this show but never felt the urge to watch it since I've never been a fan of a medieval setting and I'd started to grow tired of over the top gore and sex, but still I wanted to find out what I was missing since so many people seemed to like it.

All I can say is that I'm pleasantly surprised. I've just finished Season 7 and while I was watching I couldn't stop. It quite literally sucks you in. Yes there is A LOT of gore and sex but there are many genuinely heartwarming moments too. It does drag on a bit at certain points and there are several subplots that pretend to be important to the story that I actually ended up skipping, but for the most part the story is brilliant and complex and filled with both genuinely good and wonderfully despicable characters. The cinematography is also georgeous and the world is stunning and diverse. I'm looking forward to the final season.

Overall I'd say that it is really worth a watch. Don't be put off by the fact that it's got blood and boobs and just watch it! You won't regret it!"
671,This is one show which has captured the attention of masses like no other. The characters make sure that there is always something more to offer I was amazed at the buzz this show is creating in terms of fan theories.
672,"Television Review: ""Game of Thrones"" (2011-2018)

When I finally broke into Season Three of the year 2013 with recapping Season One and Two in a non-stop train of surprises and well-written suspension-twists, at a time when every episode challenges of being of feature-film-qualities in visuals / sound design with scoring composer Ramin Djawadi emotions, Alik Sakharov cinematography-pushing, Frances Parker constant-pacing editorials and the ocassional directions of Alan Taylor, Tim Van Patten and peak-strikes by the end of Stannis Baratheon's oceanic armada invading late-season-two-episode ""Blackwater"" directed by Neil Marshall, known for contemporary Action-Horror ""The Descent"" (2005) and helming new ""Hellboy"" interpretations for late 2018 feature releases, when fantasy alterations by relentlessly-pouring writer George R.R. Martin of rebounding well-researched J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973) mythology, Philip K. Dick's source material filteration methods and novelist Lloyd Alexander's high-fantasy imaginations of the 1960s / 1970s to get picked up with high-scale production value of 10 Million Pounds each with HBO-contracted show creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, whose only dilemma had become not letting go with striking seven-time ten-episode-seasons of shear jaw-dropping sword-metal-sparking actions accompanied in haunting black magic, a long-time hidden pale-blue-eyed ""Night King"" of a life-to-death-transforming Underworld in fire and ice, where battling as intriguing seven kingdoms expose chambers of full-nudity and gut-ripping character death portrayals performed by a constantly-compelling main cast, led by men-dominating females surrounding actress Lena Headey as delegating queen-mother, Emilia Clarke as breathing-fire-spitting-dragons-bearing from enslavement, then married, climbing-thrones for herself to avenge a last-survivor-tribe of ""The Targaryen"" towards skills-throughout-learning minor-turning-adults Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams as sisters of more and more favored, because-betrayed clan of ""The Starks"", with honored reminiscene of fulminate-thriller beginnings under ""Iron Throne"" ruling Ned Stark played by Sean Bean, when actors Kit Harington as Jon Snow and Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister hold the show morally-together to far-out promises, believed-to-be-seen epic conclusions.

673,"I am usually not the type of person that watches TV-series. Of all the TV-series, I only liked Breaking Bad and of course Game of Thrones! Game of thrones is without comparison the best of those two.

To begin with I thought it was another over-hyped show, until i read some of the reviews and the user ratings on IMDb, then I gave it a chance. By the end of the first episode, i was already hooked. There is so much going on at the same time and you will never bored watching this masterpiece of a TV show. The characters are all amazing.

One of the best part is (like breaking bad) you can't really figure out what is going to happen. If you want to watch a TV show that contains it all; love, war, greed, treachery, violence, suspense and much more, then you have come to the perfect place. You will find many characters that you will either hate or love, and George R.R. Martin is not afraid of killing one or two of your favorite characters. After all, Valar morghulis (all men must die)"
674,"After reading some of the reviews here, I was very amused, mostly about the strong contrast in positive and negative opinions. First of all, just to clarify, I agree with the majority. I love the show, and it's great. As good and as mindblowing awesome as Breaking Bad? No, probably not. That is just not possible. Therefore I gave it only a 9, and it's anyway a bad idea to compare shows with each other.

When you review GoT, or read reviews, or watch it, or plan to watch it, there is one thing you have to keep in mind. Have you read the books?

People are complaining about the plot, the enormous amount of characters, the constant dying of those characters, and the slow pace. Well, considering that this show is based on literature of epic dimensions, the show is doing a great job adapting to it.

If you haven't read the book, the amount of characters and the storyline, might be confusing to you. Although the story has been already simplified. The slow pace is just a huge build-up, for the last books to come, what I expect to be one hell of a showdown.

If you don't like nudity and violence, don't watch the show and don't read the books. If you think it's to much to see an actor brother and sister pretending to have sex, well, don't watch the show.

My advice to anyone out there is to read the books. I did, and the show for me is now a tightly packed summary of them. Does it bother me? No, because I know how difficult and complicated it must be, to produce this show.

So when forming your own opinion about GoT, keep one thing in mind. The books. Have you read them, or not?"
675,"I give this show some accolades so far for sticking to the books pretty well. The acting was actually very good as well as the costumes. I can't say I was a huge fan of the settings. Something was missing that I could not put my finger on. Maybe too much CGI? I'd prefer real sets in this story I think, where possible. I'm getting a little tired of the same type modern computer graphics look in all these different series on the various networks. The other problem was the speed they attempted to introduce the characters. Seems like I couldn't quite get an endearment for any of them yet. I guess they were just trying to get people hooked from the beginning and introduce the whole map area and various families. I'm not sure that worked well in practice. I'll watch the whole thing with the hope that it works out well, but I am not real overly impressed with the beginning. Not bad, just not excellent."
676,"Having watched the first 3 episodes of this show, including a somewhat unpromising first, it is arguable that I should allow the plot to unravel further before passing judgement.

To begin with the most positive aspect of Game of Thrones, there is a lot of beauty on display. It would appear that a great deal of thought and endeavour was put into the scenery and setting.

However, I struggle to understand how this show has managed to garner so much in the way of positive reviews and ratings when it appears to fall down on so many levels. The casting for this show, with the exception of Sean Bean, is disturbingly poor. The uninspiring characters are played by a host of rustic looking actors with limited appeal. The show is further handicapped by the slothful plot progression.

To surmise, the hype generated by this series is unjustified. The average rating on IMDb for this show (at the time of writing) stands at 9.5/10 - is ""Game of Thrones"" really in the same bracket as ""The Wire"" or ""The Sopranos""? Or even ""Rome""? This series lacks so much that all truly great shows possess - namely, intuitive casting and clever or memorable dialogue. Thus far ""Game of Thrones"" has proved to be a disappointment."
677,"I gave up on episode five as I found myself bored stupid. I love fantasy, but this so called epic was as captivating as a watching as watching a magnolia wall dry. Two dimensional characters, dull script and Sean Bean proving again he can't act."
678,In my opinion season 6 of GOT is the worst season ever made in the history of TV series. This season started good but lost its pace in the middle episodes. The only episode that I've enjoyed in this season is 'the door'. If you're thinking of start watching GOT leave it instead watch breaking bad. That show is a masterpiece.
679,"Game of thrones is simply the best television show of it's genre. It never disappoints and has a large cast of actors who are perfect for their roles. This is my individual opinion but I would highly suggest watching it. I never thought I would enjoy it as much as I have but that's because game of thrones delivers on a great story, compelling characters and a vast world which was created by George RR Martin."
680,"I'm not kidding. Game of thrones changed my whole life since I've started reading ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" by the genius called George R.R. Martin. There's no way to describe how my life changed after that, It's just something you feel. Everyday I spend time thinking stuff linked to this whole World. You're not in front of a simple books' saga, or a TV show, We're talking about a cultural phenomenon without precedents. It's right to think that I'm totally exaggerating, but trust me, I'm not. I could talk to you for days, oh what am I saying, months about the plot or whatever, but that's not my point. Making you a little more conscious of what Game of Thrones means, oh yeah, that's what I'm doing!"
681,"For some people, they like to be bias and argue their favorite as the best of all. Personally, as a person that has seen over 10k movies and hundreds of shows to completion. It is clear which shows truly stand out from the rest.

Friends, for example, is easily the greatest comedic television show ever. At one point, I really thought Modern Family was going to match it, and then even the Big Bang Theory makes a strong push. But, Friends, from start to finish S1 to S10 was solid. Very rarely was there an episode I did not enjoy. That can't be said for almost all shows. Breaking Bad, The Wire, Shameless. These are all concrete story lines within our own reality. Magnificent shows, well written, acted, directed and so forth. But.......

Game of Thrones based of George . Martins ASOIAF has displayed to me a series unlike any other I have ever seen. Being a fantasy and sci fi geek, I know my fair share of top notch effects, sound, set design, and prop aspects. GOT transcends the word show. The reason I say that is because, every time I sit down to watch the 50+ min episode on Sunday night, I feel like I'm settling in to watch an epic film. I could break down every aspect, but let's be honest here, unbiasedly, because I have my own favorite shows, GOT makes its glory obvious. The characters. The special effects. The score. The costumes. The makeup. The lighting. The attention to detail in every single scene. The suspense. The humour. The drama. The terror. I will be blunt, GOT is not for the faint of heart, because some scenes will make even the manliest man squint. But the overall entertainment value attributed to GOT is unmatched and anyone that says otherwise, would need to provide a series with a very strong case that covers every aspect of what makes a series good. You may think the story and acting is all that matters, but it's not. Others watch the show for the color, the originality, the set design, the music. Others for the action and violence and DRAGONS!! Can't really beat Dragons. Especially when Game of Thrones goes above and beyond to make them as real as you could imagine.

Game of Thrones is the past, present, and future of our reality whether you realize it or not. I just hope others can appreciate the majesty that is Game of Thrones and what it truly represents."
682,"Started out very well. 1st season was gripping, witty, entertaining. Season 2 and 3 were also quite good. I was very keen on watching every episode as soon as possible.

But from season 3 to season 5 negatives of the show have increased as positives became tiresome or non existent.

Many boring episodes consisting of pointlessly long torture scenes mixed with action scenes and repetitiveness.

The show has become convoluted and tries to fit in too much. Subplots don't work well. Character development suffers in place of shock scenes. I don't particularly care for any of the characters anymore. Which is all disappointing.

Season 5 I did not enjoy much past the first few episodes (they were good though).

If I wanted cliffhangers and a budgeted formula, I'd watch the CW or some superhero crap; it isn't far off right now. I feel like HBO and the producers have settled on their success and aren't going to be putting in the quality they had originally. Sucks for the people jumping on board now and putting in their best.

The show was right up there with Breaking Bad, maybe not as good. But definitely a winner worthy of 7.5+ stars, but now?

I guess I'll watch it? A resounding ""meh"" for the show in its current state."
683,"Sex, sex, nudity, gore, nudity nudity nudity, story, gore. When there is a storyline, the best characters leave anyways."
684,"I could rant for hours on this show, but i'm not going to.

It is simply the best thing ever shown on television. Ever. Period.

Some things come mighty close, but GOT just tops them all.

I feel sorry for those who have never watched it.

This show has set the bar for the next 20 years."
685,"Game of thrones was the second ever watched series for me... and just because the first show that I watched was Davinci's demons... I rate it better and as the best show ever!! But that doesn't mean that I need to take anything away from GOT!!

Wonderfully written and wonderfully acted... this is what signifies GOT!! GOT features complete different worlds and stories taking place at the same time... and my god what a long way it has come... because the way it was at the beginning... and the way it is now... a big round of applause for George RR Martin and the cast and crew of the show........

There might be very few people who ain't aware of how amazing this show is... but there still are such kinda people... so do yourselves a favour and watch the best show on planet earth along with Davinci's demons!!"
686,"Game of Thrones has always had it's highs and lows in terms of quality.

The earlier seasons (1,2,3,4) had a fantastic story, interesting characters and great acting. It was quite an engrossing show and was my favourite show at the time. Yes it had it's flaws, there were some characters that got thrown away too quickly and there were plot holes that never got covered, this never tarnished my overall experience though.

It's shame that the last two seasons have not been up to standards, it's still an enjoyable show, but it's quality has dropped drastically. The flaws are more noticeable now, with characters getting introduced but getting hardly any development and getting dropped like flies with no explanation. Another problem is the pacing, some story lines are hardly moving forward and others are getting rushed.

Original rating: 9/10 Current rating: 6/10"
687,"This show is very well done. It is not often that the TV show/film will come so close to the books as far as quality and similarity. It is obviously hard to provide as much in depth character and scene descriptions as the books do. However, the books are also about 1,000 pages each.

If you have not seen the show, I would HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. Very easy to get hooked instantly. I saw the first 2 seasons before deciding to read the books. I have a job and go to school so you can understand why I was hesitant. It is definitely a time commitment. My girlfriend was not pleased, but I am halfway through the 3rd book after a month and would even say these surpass Tolkien's work (barely).

All in all, no one I have talked to personally has disliked the show. I do not think you will either. VERY ENTERTAINING!"
688,"Let me start off by saying this is hands down one of the best TV shows on the air today. Unfortunately part of me can't help but wonder if it's the lack of other quality TV options most of the time that lead me to feel that way.

There is a lot to love here: quality acting, nicely done sets, great attention to detail in props and scenery. Judged on it's own merits there is a lot to enjoy and take in. As a spectacle of it's own this is among the best TV has to offer, with only a handful of movies (with larger budgets) that can top it for its genre.

The problem is; this has source material. Being based on a book series that is simply far and away the best of it's kind printed in the last decade. Having read the books this is where the problems with the show begin to bleed through: the plot simply is not as good as it pretends to be.

You have A-list material from the books which could have been lifted page for page; but instead the show writers have chosen to not only truncate the dialogue but also write in their own mediocre scenes.

Don't get me wrong, I fully understand cutting some things simply because the books are so much longer. But what I can't agree with is cutting material and than replacing it: that means you did have time for things you skipped...

The stuff being added is B-grade at best.

That's the shows biggest sin; dumping good scenes and adding in fluff. The laundry list of other changes (characters that were cut; merged and otherwise changed) is also a bit unsettling. The entire ""game of thrones"" has essentially been dumbed down for TV. What should be a chess game of monarchs is watered down to a couple of idiots playing checkers. Some of the blood lines for example instead of having multiple heirs only have 1 and the threats and plots surrounding them have been simplified or nearly cut entirely. And in its place? Extra sex scenes from minor characters.

The show is at it's best when it stays true to the books, the dialogue and plot twists shine and keep you engaged. Than it wanders off into la-la land where the writers think they know better than the source material and all I can do is shake my head and wonder just how truly epic and amazing this could have been.

So; is the show good? Yea. Just not as good as it should have been. They were handed the keys to one of the most well developed fantasy worlds ever written, and I just wish they would stop hiding under the bed sheets and stick to the source material.

In summary all I can tell you is this: Read the books. Unless you lack imagination and reading comprehension it will be one of the best reads of your life.

Watch the show afterwards and take it for what it's worth: a 9 that should have been a 10."
689,"Seriously, I just watched the last episode of season 2 and I got blown away... Forgive me for my bad English, but this is so damn awesome! Just watch it and you'll get totally stuck by season 2 or even season 1, its just amazing! I still consider Lost as the best series ever because it is so damn hard to get and so smart and great actors and an awesome story line thanks to J.J Abrams and others. I beg you to watch it and watch Lost to you wont regret it! This show has it all, it's a lot of nudity in it but just enough to get you into the time where this story is played out. I'ts a lot of fighting and love affairs and all that you're looking for and a lot more! You will not regret that you're watching this believe me!"
690,"HBO puts a lot of sex in its dramas, even the ones that compete for awards. Most of their shows have a kind of rhythmic cycle-- 20 minutes of drama, 30 seconds of porn. Game of Thrones goes a lot farther than once every 20 minutes. If I didn't know it was based on a book, and so many reviewers weren't raving about how faithful it was to the book, I'd swear it was just an excuse to create a very expensively produced dungeons and dragons themed porn series. Instead of the sex spicing up the plot, the plot seems designed to create lots of opportunities to have a lot of sex. There's sex between fraternal twins, gay sex, extramarital sex, brutal sex, orgy sex, prostitute sex, little people sex, rape sex, and some other varieties I've probably forgotten about already. None of this is necessarily a bad thing, but it does make the show seem less serious, or at least harder to take it seriously. This also makes it a kind of anti-Narnia or anti-Lord of the Rings, as romantic, sentimental moral idealism doesn't figure much in this world and there are no religious themes to speak of. These often duplicitous characters are simply trying to make their way in a hostile, cynical, and steamy world where dragons and zombies are just part of the landscape.

On the plus side, production values are extravagant and lush and most of the cast is first rate. This is the first mostly Belfast-based show I've ever seen and vividly bright green is everywhere. Some of the costumes, particularly the fancier armor suits, are incredibly beautiful and are no doubt up for some emmy nominations. Maisie Williams, a 14-year-old actress playing a character that's probably a few years younger, is remarkable. Don't worry, she's too young to make it into the porn scenes. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, a Danish actor without a trace of an accent, also stands out as one of the many evil-yet-charming-and-good-looking villains. Aiden Gillen, previously the uppity city councilman on The Wire, is both from Ireland and in this.

So, will you like it? Not if too much sex annoys you. On the other hand, if you've always wanted to sexually liberate the knights, maidens, dragons, and dwarfs to make whoopie on screen, this is absolutely the show that will do it for you."
691,"I forced myself to watch all the episodes of Game of Thrones and just couldn't get into it. It doesn't seem to know exactly what it is or where it is going. I think it's trying to be another ""Lost"" or ""24"" - aiming to continue forever.

The storyline is strangely ""untogether"" and it is not sure if it is a mythical tale or monster movie. The producers have gone to great lengths to find bizarre characters to populate the screen and surprise us - but they don't ""gell"""" together.

I still cannot work out why they are all talking with northern English accents (I keep waiting for ""ee by gum it's coud up 'ere innit"" to be thrown into the conversation).

Obviously unsure of their own product, large dollops of sex have been thrown into the pot to make it sell. The final 'thing' is uneven and unsatisfying. Perhaps ""Game of Thrones part 274"" will be better....."
692,Season 1 : 9/10 Season 2 : 8.5/10 Season 3 : 9.5/10 Season 4 : 10/10 Season 5 : 9/10 Season 6 : 10/10 Season 7 : 8.5/10
693,"It's a good show but it's too much slow, even people who love game of thrones more than anything else still felt boring during some of these episodes. I like it but not more than Breaking Bad, i'll tell you why because it's too slow, they stretch story too much. For example in Season 2 Jon Snow dragging that girl in the whole episodes and there are more scenes like this one. There is less than half Thrill if you compare it with Breaking Bad. It's about opinions, you should watch it if you haven't yet."
694,"This is one of those rare incidences where the adaptation is better than the books! I've read the books and prefer the series. It's grim, grimy and everyone, except a few, are truly nasty!! Brilliantly done and fantastic acting. As yet I don't know how the story wraps up but Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) had better survive!!

However, there is a big HMMMMMM coming on!!

At the moment I'm reading the fabulous Helliconia Trilogy (Spring, Summer, Winter) by Brian Aldiss. This majestic tale encompasses (amongst other things) extreme climate change and in the final volume published in 1985 there is the repeated phrase 'Winter is Coming'.

1985? You do the math!"
695,"I highly recommend this show as it contains lots of action, drama, suspense, and a lot of character development! You can't deny that the most exciting aspects of this show include sex and fighting but most importantly it contains dragons! The first few seasons are a bit slow but then the show starts to pick up by seasons 4 and 5. I also recommend trying to watch the show with your undivided attention as there are lots of pertinent information presented via body language and dialogue besides all the action sequences! One of the best shows that I have seen so far!"
696,"I'm going to preface this review by stating that I usually dislike medieval-themed shows. This show really is like no other. Even though it started off slowly, it has cemented itself as one of the best shows of all time. I have been watching it since the second season and I have loved it ever since. Even when the episodes seem like they are dull and go on for a very long time, they have a purpose and are always well-done. This show is excellent in every way, from the acting, the writing, the cinematography, the score/music, it's absolutely wonderful. It's filled with interesting, complex characters and situations that are introduced every season. It somehow remains fresh and constantly surprises and impresses me every season. Even though some people may see it as overrated, it's still an undeniably excellent show, regardless of your personal preference. It manages to be hilarious, heartbreaking, interesting, intriguing, and dark all the same time.

Whilst this show may not be ideal for those who have read the books, I imagine it is still fascinating to see these character and this vast world come to life. There's something in this show for everyone; fans of practically every genre can appreciate the hard work and art the cast and crew produce that is evident in every episode. The first season may seem confusing and overwhelming to take in at first, but after you manage to sit through it and watch how all the different plot lines and characters progress, you'll realize how crucial the first season was and how great it actually was. The character development and acting, not to mention the superbly done special effect, are what really stand out; and for good reason. Give this show a try and be part of the ever-growing fan-base or just check out what all the fuss is about. However biased it may sound, this really is the best show I have ever had the fortune of watching over and over again. I hope many more continue to appreciate the overall greatness of the world George R. R. Martin has created."
697,"I'm a newcomer to the show.

This is a pretty great show, but it has to be your cup of tea: the fantasy genre.

It's ambitious and epic in scope, no doubt about it, but at the same time this is a niche genre that you must have interest in because it's very extreme in that nothing here is realistic.

For me, I prefer realism, or at least shows that can be happening in the present day or recently.

Still, I can see how lots of people like this. I'm not one to hop on the bandwagon and follow the crowd, which is why I've just now caught up on Season 1. I think many people just want to be in with the know of the pop culture relevance so they watched to keep up with friends' conversations; quite normal actually for hit shows.

Besides being total fantasy, another thing which bothered me was there are way too many characters to have to follow. I like shows that are more focused in tight and centralized around 1-3 characters.

In summary, this show is like Braveheart (setting, time period, accents) but with way more characters and a total work of fiction.

I can see the praise it gets, but because the genre isn't my preference, it's not my favorite. I like realism. So far, it's pretty amazing and I'm impressed. I'll be back to modify my thoughts, however, as I catch up on proceeding seasons.

8.5/10"
698,"After watching the first episode, I was instantly hooked. Game of Thrones is one of those rare shows that has everything it needs to qualify as a spectacular television programme: good quality dialogue, intriguing characters, stunning cinematography, well- choreographed battle sequences and plot lines that have been crafted and developed with fastidious care.

It is of the medieval-fantasy genre, which will surely appeal to fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and other such works. But it is more than this- it is able to weave elements of political drama with the fantasy, something that is most noticeable in the King's Landing story-line. This provides a contrasting sense of realism that makes it more engaging.

One of my only issues with the show is the overabundance of characters across the seasons, which has led to a lack of character development in certain characters, like Stannis Baratheon, whose story-line has continually bored me. Such excess characters decrease screen-time for other more interesting ones like Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, who have more to offer in terms of their emotionally rich journeys.

Other than that, Game of Thrones is a show that continues to grow as each season passes, and never fails to surprise, which only serves to increase the amount that viewers invest themselves in the characters. Although it has been panned by some people for its 'gratuitous sex scenes' and 'excessive gore', personally I think it adds to the show's portrayal of a gritty and corrupt medieval world, wrought by chaos and destruction.

Overall, I would highly recommend Game of Thrones, particularly to those who enjoy medieval-fantasy and political dramas. It is totally worthy of all the hype that it has going for it :)."
699,"Bindge watched the entire series, and found it impossible to turn away. There is a character for everyone to get caught up in. It has all of the elements to keep even the most frugal audience riveted. I found multiple characters and story lines that captivated my viewing attention. Every season has a great number of suspenseful plot turns that will most certainly surprise you. Just when you think you know what will happen, things can change drastically. Even when a character is perceived to be dead, there is always a chance that they can be saved through the wonders of witchcraft. The kingdoms battle each other, only to prepare for a battle of the ages with the White Walkers. Winter is surely coming, so be prepared to get beyond that wall and suited up for the war."
700,"(Updated after Season 6)

Set in a fantasy land (though, in many ways, very similar to Earth in the Middle ages) the stories of several families and individuals and their quest for power. In particular, they all want the Iron Throne...

Great, epic fantasy drama, based on the books by George RR Martin. Though focusing on several individuals, it contains clever interlocking story lines, weaving family feuds, power trips and pure greed and malice.

Superb cinematography, settings and scenery. Performances are spot- on too.

On the negative side, there are possibly too many stories being told simultaneously. Too many characters in the story I don't care about. This is particularly so in Seasons 3 and 4.

Characters, often heroes and seemingly there for the long haul, get killed off in the blink of an eye, and out of the blue. This is good and bad. Good in that it shows that, as in life, there are no certainties and ""heroes"" / very likable characters with depth aren't necessarily immortal (this is definitely not Disney!). On the other hand, it leaves you feeling distant and unengaged. It's difficult to support a character when they could be killed off at any moment.

Also, too many plot twists and gruesome killings, just for shock value. Not that I have an issue with watching killings, they just seem gratuitous and over-indulgent at times. While the plot is good and the characters have depth, it isn't all substance - style plays its part and sometimes the dial is too much over to the style side.

This all said, it does start to come together from Season 5 onwards. Seasons 1 and 2 were good, and set up the story for some great development in Season 3. Unfortunately, Seasons 3 and 4 drifted somewhat. Season 5 gets us back on track and Season 6 propels the story forward in a big way. Season 6 would the best of the lot."
701,"I've watched countless shows over the years, but Game of Thrones is the show that impacted me the most. It's an obsession and in my opinion it is literally the best show ever made! From the characters to the plot, from the huge world to every little backstory, everything is just so amazing. Its hard to describe in words. Game of thrones isn't afraid to challenge its viewers to hang on while it twists and turns like an angry beast, you will be challenged, but if you are able to endure, you will be in for one heck of a ride. The world of Westeros has consumed me, I think about Game of Thrones even when I'm busy doing other things, this is the first time a TV show or movie has done this to me. Watch this show, if you are a fan of fantasy, i guarantee you, you will not be disappointed!"
702,"I'll keep it short.

It's an amazing show that really sucks you in and makes you talk about it with your friends for days.You have the feeling that everything in the show actually happened,making you bond to the characters even more.And unlike many shows this one doesn't go far from the book.

That's all until the 5th season.After that you don't know what's happening.The show runners D&D keep ruining your favorite book characters and writing stories that don't happen in the books all for the sake of the ""shock factor"".The whole season 5 is based on ""wow,look at this,this is so shocking"".In the last episode in literally every scene there's a death and most of them don't happen in the books.

I strongly recommend watching it up until the 5th season and then start reading the books.Oh,and the only good scenes in season 5 are ""The walk of shame"",""Hardhome"" and the last scene in season 5.They are brilliantly acted out and follow the books by letter."
703,"Every generation had a defining series, but this one has Game of Thrones. A fantastical world of Westeros, not unlike our own medieval Europe, is beset by different problems and riddled with court intrigue as well as plots. Families struggle either to maintain their position or to dominate Westeros. The soundtrack is excellent, the story-line and narrative is superb, the characters are fully three-dimensional, morality is realistic and the show's many plot-twists are shocking, yet realistic enough not to cause the ""shock for shock-value's sake"" feeling. Actors, although many are not well known, are memorable and they possess some real acting skill. Simply an excellent, tense series keeping you constantly on the edge."
704,"To begin I am irritated by some of the negative reviews.

Unlike so many 'less-than-average' productions churned out these days Game of Thrones does not patronize its audience by spelling out its plot or playing grim music to identify the bad guys and the sweet whistle of bird song to glorify our heroes.

I will concede the point that the sex is excessive but not always needlessly so. The scenes with lord Baelish for example do set the contrast of the characters life in court with his main profession.

So many of the negative reviews criticise the pace of the story and claim that it is disjointed with too many characters. Indeed a 2 hour film would have to get to the point but a series has the luxury of developing the story and characters slowly and over the course of time.

We are deliberately mislead to believe that Rob Stark's march south would give the audience the justice that the Lanister's deserve. But if we carry that forward and Rob had claimed victory, then when the Mother of Dragons inevitably reached the shores of Kings Landing, would it be Rob Stark's Kingdom that she would be burning? Basically the Bad guys need to win for now so that we can enjoy Daenerys' sacking of the south ensuring that their will be plenty of Dragon Fodder.

More on this point, to those who lack the patients to understand the logic of the story-line. If Winterfell is the most northerly town then it would surely be the first to fall in either a Wildling attack of the Kingdoms or the advance of the white-walkers. With the rangers withered the Wilding army under Mance Rayder will be the first fodder that the audience cares nothing about and will hold the wall and take the brunt of the White Walker attack. We now have a foe in Lord Brighton as warden of the north who we can happily watch die at Winterfell with a sense of justice.

Thus the story will play out as the seven kingdoms, repressed by their kings and wars flock to the Queen of Dragons and her liberated slaves to raise an army to march North to reclaim civilization from the White walkers.

Bran, Rickon and Arya will rise to give us the relief from the injustices done the the noble Stark family by surviving the war and they all live happily ever after."
705,"Wot a television series, if you like anything fantasy then this is for you, it has it all, I'm just gutted the SEASONS are only 10 episodes long(or is it 12, not sure ) then its a long year to get your fix of another.....GREAT STUFF AND KEEP IT COMING...LONGER SEASONS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. If you love fantasy then this is definitely for you, the casting is superb, the acting is superb, the costumes are awesome, and the scenery is something else, even the music is brilliant, i cant put down in words how much i love this show, and count the days to the next episode or season, i wont even watch any trailers that are released so that i get more compulsive viewing...again 10/10 sheer brilliance, I'm going to read the books next."
706,"I've read every book in Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire (a Game of Thrones) and let me say so far the show does a good job in keeping the spirit alive with only slight adaptations. The characters are very well casted and portray the characters from the book series brilliantly. The rawness and edginess of the show is fitting for that time period and brings the viewer back to the medieval times. The only advice I can give is that to truly understand the show (as well as the book series) is to study and remember the details, the characters, and their allegiance. This is a very dynamic story with many characters all of whom share an important part of the story."
707,"(this is a review for all the seasons so far With no spoilers)

When i sat down to watch ""a game of thrones"" i honestly thought it would be a second rate lord of the rings. Boy was i wrong.

This show has quickly become not just my favorite TV show but one o my Favorite sources of entertainment in film music and TV. The story is very interesting with now section over explained or under-explained. The characters are INCREDIBLE (my favorite has to be tyiron) and you find your self caring or characters or hating characters.

This show will have you laughing crying and even shouting at your TV screen shout ""kill the little s*** Kill Him"" (or is that just me)"
708,"I kind of click on first episode of GOT out of blue. The moment episode started, the music caught my attention. When the episode ended, I knew it would be a good ride till the end. And i was not disappointed, I deeply enjoyed the show. The acting was excellent. The cast was amazing. Sean Bean was amazing. All the supporting cast did really good job. I really enjoyed Emilia Clark""s part. She is beautiful and acts really well. THe show is closely related to everyday life and struggle of different part of the world tries to get a piece of action (just like the present situation of the World where all countries are trying to get upper hand on others ). Overall, its one of the best show that came out. If you have not watch it yet, then arrange your stuff and have a look."
709,"Although there have been a few tweaks here and there from the first book in the series, everything about the first series of ""Game of Thrones"" lived up to my expectations and exceeded it. That's what great TV is about. The writers, cast, directors and everyone else have done a superb job with the source material. My only complaint is the second series is also to be called ""Game of Thrones"". 'A Clash of Kings' needs to be its subtitle or, the series should've been titled after the full name of the novel series 'A Song of Ice and Fire' and then with the subtitles of the different novels beneath. Now, the torture of waiting until April 2012 begins. I have high expectations for series two including the epic skirmish the Battle of Blackwater Bay. That should be a thrill though due to budgetary reasons they may have to whittle it down. Let the ""Clash"" begin."
710,"I hope this gets better, and I am mindful that a) this comment is based on the first episode, b) I am in a minority, and c) it can only get better.

Firstly the opening sequence was riveting right up until the explanations and disposition. Secondly most of the acting was fine, although the film hardly spent enough time on creating understandable characters and rather too much time spinning from location to location. And thirdly in my main beefs about this opening episode, the closing sequence was telegraphed.

The translation of a story into screenplay is an art, especially so in the making of a TV series, where it is important to explore characters in such a way as to make you have feelings for them. This opening episode did none of that for me. I really didn't care. I was bored by dialogues which, like the opening sequence, promised so much but couldn't deliver. I really didn't care for anyone after this forty minutes or so.

I do hope it gets better and I will watch episode two just to make sure I didn't see it on a off night (it would have been two off nights because I watched it twice just in case I'd missed something) but actually this is a case where the trailers are better than the real thing. Here's hoping for a better part two."
711,"My encounter with this series was very brief. After watching 6 minutes of first episode I had already enough. Actors crawling, walking and even running in obvious plastic snow or whatever material was already a pain to watch. And even as they walked and ran you see no vapor from their breaths whatsoever. If you start a series in this way when you should really get the audience attention and you make such ""mistakes"" I don't wanna see it. Maybe my bad but in 2011 this kind of mistakes can be easily be overcome. I see it as an insult to the audience what could have been a good series.

Furthermore, the part of the dialog I saw was also rather poor and did not appeal to me at all."
712,"This is True Blood medieval style. If you're a fan of that title, you may relax the critical elements of your brain to overcome what is a very average show. If you don't think much of True Blood, you'll be unimpressed with this show's mediocrity and non-stop attempts to overcome it with frequent, gratuitous nudity and violence. Additionally, you'll be bewildered by Game of Thrones getting a 9.5 out of 10 rating on IMDb, as of writing. Wow, how the hell.

With few exceptions, the acting is often poor. The script, however much it accurately portrays the written work, is easy to tune out from. The allure of an implied, mysterious fantasy story is replaced by family politics and repetitive boring bickering. The setting can regularly appear well constructed and suitable. Production values overall are quite nice as is seemingly standard with current HBO works. But, ultimately it's a very mediocre TV show."
713,"I watched the first episode of this series. I believe that this series cant be in best series. this series have not Excellent story and actors of this series is not popular and best. Although, I like Historical but this series is not good in Historical series. some people believe that this TV series is magnificent ,but i now that they are mistake. While I watched the first episode I had not the same excitement,as the time when I watched the first episode of Walking Dead TV series. some people believe that this story is complex, its original, its fresh, and it is very exciting.I accept that this TV series is complex but i cant accept that this TV series is fresh and exiting."
714,"people, are you OK to like it? I can't believe my eyes when i see this rating. How come? the lunatic plot? the sadistic enjoyment of unnecessary deaths and brutally? the frequency of nude bodies made me feel i was in public bath or better say in meat department. oh, yes, how could i forget... false a la medieval theme decorations tat surrounded this bull ... this story is teenagers, who suffer from suppressed sexuality and dreaming about crazy revenge he will make on his classmates, who bully him everyday. Everything is very dark and depressing and all he can do is to build the fantasy kingdom, to hide himself behind the tall walls and enjoy, enjoy beating his enemies and humiliation of queens.Sad story. To enjoy this bull, the viewers have to share the same mentality

that how it feels and how it looks. 2,5 is too much."
715,"When a man on back of the horse plays with the body of a woman which is horse rider and then he'll understand she is her sister, this really sounds to me as a sick storyline. When I see the lupanar scenes of the king and they shows some kinda weak men, this really sounds to me as nothing. If I'm going to watch these scenes, easily I can type in my browser x-v-i-d-e-o-s and enjoy more. Just enough to compare it with a brilliant series like Sherlock Holmes. I hope this could turned on this genre fans, this genre really make me sick in real life. I'm not religious but I really respect to religions and some of their rules for my life and I've experienced this in real not just by hearing some words."
716,"To be honest, I can't figure out what's so exciting about Game of Thrones. I started to watch it because everybody was talking about it and it had a very good rating at IMDb. But since the very first episode, I found it kind of an exhausted model. It is a mix of a Lord of the rings (setting from the middle ages, different people living together in an invented world, strange languages, some witchcraft) and Spartacus (half naked warriors, a lot of sex, hookers and boobs). It's just more of the same. Who knows, perhaps that's what people like. I just can't afford to waste 1h of my day on this. I'll rather watch a good movie"
717,"I only really liked a few episodes, not much happens. More naked scenes than action, if I wanted to watch that much skin and sex scenes I would turn to something else."
718,"Starting watching this when this first aired, before everyone could not shut the hell up about it. I grew weary of it and lost interest after a number of seasons. I had forgotten what episode I had gotten up to as it all became increasingly frustrating.

Someone who had not watched this previously, could not do so without having some unrealistic expectations by the amount of over-hyping this gets. This would take 65+ hours straight binge watching to get up-to-date. I am so gloriously behind that I never, ever want to catch up.

Excellent production values and cinematography, etc. contrary to my opinion expressed above. Alas, this show is not for me. This is just my opinion as unpopular as it maybe."
719,"I have watched a lot of TV shows and in my option this is the best TV series so far in my 48 years on this spinning ball, the acting, writing, directing and production and the rest is phenomenal. In July 2015 i made a top ten list on IMDb putting The sopranos at number one, have now given the number one spot to Game Of Thrones, will my number one spot change in the future, anything is possible, Game Of Thrones will be very hard to beat, i think it has set an exceptionally high bar."
720,Deducting a star for including the horribly untalented Ed Sheeran in the season 7 opener. Game of Thrones should not stoop to ridiculous stunt casting. I will give the star back if someone chops off his head. I will completely delete this review if there is a published apology on top of that.
721,"I've never been much for sci-fi or fantasy shows, and I'm never gonna be like those folks who dress up, at comic con, and spend small fortunes on memorabilia. That being said, this show is the only one I have ever gone ""geek"" over. It came on back in 2011, and I watched it on a free weekend of HBO. After the first episode, I ordered HBO, and began watching it every week. It was pretty cool. It's a great story, and even though it's coming to an end, I really hope they decide to the spin offs from the books I keep hearing about. It's definitely a show my wife and I make sure the kids are in bed first before we watch. A lot of language, sex, violence, and gore in this series, so it's not something you want your kids to watch. I'm looking forward to buying the audio books, to get more out of the plot lines. It's a must watch that will have you hooked into it at the first episode or three. I highly recommend it."
722,"simply this show is the best show that I've seen yet , for me it's better than breaking bad . cant wait for the next season (season 7) , i guess it's going to be the best season . there's this thing about game of thrones that everyone that hear about it will hate it just let them watch an episode or two they will fall in love with it latterly . most people hate game of thrones because they hear that it's all about sex and violence , first thing is there a life without sex or violence ? second of all please just watch the series then judge it ."
723,"This is with out a doubt The Greatest Show Ever. No competition. This series have everything from amazing writing, story, dialog, acting, directing, visuals and also the scale of it is unbelievable. Their will never be another show like this. Never. Everyhing about it is gold, better than gold really. To be honest this show is better than anything i have ever seen on screen. Better than any movie. It's just out of this world. Thank you HBO for bringing this for us to watch over and over again. I will never get tired of it. Never."
724,"I know it's silly to call a TV series ""perfect"", but I find it hard to see what could have been made significantly better. Sure, Lena Headey sometimes makes a bit too much of her crooked smile, and Harry Lloyd may be a bit too slimy. But these are marginal notes, a hundred times over compensated by the work of Sean Bean, Peter Dinklage and others. But the acting, of course, is only a part of it - you can find excellent acting in lots of British shows. What makes this one so special is how everything is welded together, from the basic Medieval fantasy story, to Machiavelli and the power play of modern politics. The scenery is gorgeous, the costume is so good you can smell the leather (and you seriously wonder if the characters ever take a bath). Well, yes - I do have one major complaint. I would have preferred to watch the whole series in one go. The cliffhangers drives me crazy."
725,"Visually stunning, amazingly plotted, well - adapted from the novels, beautifully performed...I mean, what is there not to love about this series? The sheer plot twists give this fantasy tale the gritty reality that ""the good guys do not always win."" Indeed, in George R. R. Martin's world, they often lose -- tragically. But hope always lives in those who survive and eventually the strands of alliances come together to forge a powerful force of societal change."
726,"I truly tried to give this show a chance. I watched the first season and as four time rape survivor I was completely mortified at what is being called the ""greatest show of all time."" The writers should be ashamed of themselves as they glorified the rape scenes in the book and made them more entertaining for viewers. I understand that this stuff would have taken place during medival times but the need to show it graphically and so often is completely unnecessary! So glad the show only has one season left!"
727,"Because of the hoopla over this show I have downloaded and watched the first two series.

Boy, is it slow... like watching a ship move out of its mooring, it's slow! Blackadder is much better than this and it also has Lord Flashheart.

The best character is the dwarf with his horrendous accent that makes Dick Van Dyke's Cockney waanker in Mary Poppins sound word-perfect! I can't believe that not one of the almost entirely British cast didn't have the balls or dignity to sidle up to the director and mention this awful, catastrophic and annoying accent. Was he doing it on purpose as some kind of joke?

Anyway, that aside, these hour-long episodes could easily have been edited down to 20 minutes or so, without anyone losing a moment of plot significance. Nothing much happens except people chat about the past and make plans for wars.

Lots of men hugging when they haven't seen each other for a long time or they are going off to battle, etc... something else I'm pretty sure never happened in the olden days.

Overall, even after you list every other fault this mess has, the biggest one still remains the most significant... it's just dull. There is just so much boring dialog to wade through before anything happens.

I can't complete any more of this torture. I'll wait for the movie version."
728,Acting is mediocre at best. Personally I'd suggest just reading the books.
729,"I've watched all the seasons, and I remember enjoying them. But don't ask me to remember what the hell has happened before the next season hits!

Very little happens for so much of SEVEN seasons. Incredible. It's basically a soap with dragons. Don't get me wrong, that's great, but how did it last this many years?

Will be happy when it's done and i'll Know if it was worth it."
730,"This show has dominated the Spring of my life for the last 6 years and each and every season has been well worth the wait. This is the greatest show of all time and the only show that might rival it would be band of brothers or breaking bad. The book being brought to life in front of us with stunning scenery, brilliant writing and out-of-this- world acting. GRR Martin is one messed up dude but has created a masterpiece. The brilliance in the show is the individual dialogues that take place watching the true greed of man take place in the south while everyone seems to be completely forgetting about what is north of the wall.

I would recommend this show to anyone with a heart that can handle extreme drama, in-depth characters and possibly the greatest on television acting performance from Peter Dinklage. This show truly has my vote for the greatest television show of all time and the main reason people can't get into the show is that they lack the patients or attention span to focus on the show. You do actually need to watch the show to know what is going on. 10/10"
731,"Where do i start? What an epic show... The sets, the actors and the overall production. Im not one to be impressed easily but this is a great show. The suspense keeps building in each episode and you know the payoff will be worth it in the end. Favourite character? too many to choose from. I also enjoy the gory side of things and this ticks that box for this fella. I truly hope it keeps being made but shudder to think of the actual cost for each episode. As i mentioned the sets are truly epic. The costumes are first class and you really feel as though you are back in time. Maybe too many wines for me when i watch it but i feel like a kid again. And yes, i have bought my share of merchandise."
732,"The first time I tried to watch the show I wasn't impressed cause it seemed to evolve slow and I left it for a couple of months. After a while I forced my self to watch again since a friend of mine strongly recommended that I do... and damn was she right! This is one of the best TV series I have ever watched. Brilliant! An emotional roller coaster. Last episode I watched ""The door"" blew my mind. Watch GoT. You will not be disappointed. Great choice of actors and amazing performances. Also the soundtrack is unbelievable, the atmosphere is great, the level of detail and story consistency are perfect. I recommend this to everyone."
733,"I want to be truthful and say that I started watching this show this year only and I just want to say that I'm spellbound everything was just perfect from Cinematography to acting. No doubt why people like Game Of Thrones. The things that I like about the show is the way it's been showed to all of us the character representation as if they are real life, the power struggle and on a short note it teaches many things about life. Many dialogues are everyday's quotes. The show has near to perfect assembled cast. The things that I didn't like about the show is that amount of nudity they are showing which is unnecessary and irrelevant to the story. Secondly, the writers and makers include The author Itself George RR Martin, even though they are not following the book. I feel that if they follow the book then the show would be perfect and more enjoyable by the reviewers. Bottom Line: Perfect as Diamond."
734,"I'll start out by saying I've never read the books. I've been told repeatedly that I should, but thus far I've never taken the opportunity.

The very first episode of this show featured gore, death, violence, bad language, nudity, sex and incest. But, luckily, also had a strong plot and some very engaging characters. And throughout the four series that have been shown to date, nothing much has changed. It's still packed to the gunwales with all the same sort of action and each of the key characters' plots progress nicely and, to a varying degree, with some realism within the realm of the environment.

I do have a few issues with the series, though. Firstly, the Lowest Common Denominator facets of sex, nudity, violence and swearing are a bit much at times. It's definitely uncomfortable viewing with your mum, I would expect! Secondly, some of the story lines seem to either drag along or peter out without any real crescendo. Granted, it's probably more realistic that some situations just play out with little consequence, but occasionally you'll follow a storyline that really engages you, just for it to tail off disappointingly without any real conclusion. Thirdly, some of the story lines that drag on are now becoming a bit difficult to untangle from the newer plot-lines. Apparently, this is a fault with the author and not the script writers, but it does make some episodes dull and others a bit hard to follow.

But on the plus side, there's some really good characters who are hugely engaging. The Lannisters, as horrible as they are, are all strong and played well by their respective actors. With the exception of Tyrion, who is different because he's not horrible, just Machiavellian. I actually find myself rooting for him when he's in bother because he's such a brilliant part and played to perfection by Peter Dinklage. Screen Junkies say he's down to play every cool dwarf part until he dies or Warwick Davies kills him, and they're spot on with that. But even outside of this key family, the parts are very well played.

And the most intriguing part is that, even with the backing of HBO and the clearly US levels of funding it has, it's actually a British programme! It makes me proud to see that our little nation can still produce such incredible shows, and yet sad that we need our American cousins to fork out for them because we're too busy churning out crappy reality shows."
735,"I began to see this series while I was reading the fourth book. Visual effects and filming are really nice, and the environment very well recreated, and chapters are real. They added some sex that does not appear in the books, an rearranged a little the story (In the book many things happen in parallel). I am not to complain about that, because I understand that books and TV are different animals What really disappointed me about this series is that storytelling is way too fast, and some main characters are hard to differentiate from each other (specially northeners). After watching the first chapter I could only think: People that that didn't read the book must have a huge mess on their minds about who is who and what the series is about. Simply it's impossible to realize about the real extent of the plot unless you read the books (That happens with many adaptations, but in this case I think you are missing most of it if you only watch the series). The first book simply has too much content for a 10 chapter season.

Nice series, but it could have been way better if they didn't squeeze the story so much to fit a book per season."
736,"OK so I just finish watching both season 1&2 wow!!! wonderful excellent movie. So where is season three? my god! how do I get to season 3? As for the story line, it is better than Lords of the ring, don't get me wrong that was a good show too. But this show just make u sit there glued to the TV and not want to get up for fear u would miss something. So I ask again: where is season 3 or the rest of the show?????? The actors must be commended they did a wonderful job, you can see the heart and soul in this movie. Why did EDD Stark have to die so soon??? but why did EDD send his son Jon Snow to the knight's watch in the first place? and how does jon fit into the stealing of the iron throne since every1 wants to steal it, i guess his men of the knight's watch wants throne too"
737,"Often I see fantasy shows or movies on television, and as an avid reader, set out with very high expectations, hoping the show or movie will live up to the high standards set out by the book. Sadly, it is often the case that the producers have either chosen a bad book (terrible to watch, but easy to make into a production), or a long book (amazing to read, but cringe- worthy when seen on screen). George R.R. Martin's books are perfect in that they are the right size (per book) for a 10 hour series, and that they also contain the right mix of politics, sex and violence as plot devices. Too much politics will result in a boring drama-fest, too much sex results in a story-lacking, poorly made porn film aimed at enticing male viewers only, and too much violence results in a hideous gore-fest that begins to become repetitive and almost boring, making the viewer tired of seeing the colour red. Game of Thrones successfully incorporates all three of these 'touchy' elements into a watchable and incredibly enjoyable television series, one of the best, possibly THE best TV series I have ever seen. Having read all the books, I can safely say that most, if not all the content in the series matches up neatly to the content in the books. The producers don't overdo anything, keeping to what is written and favouring a complex plot in the place of aimless special effects and video tomfoolery. If you are reading this review, unsure of whether you want to devote 70 hours of your life to this series (because once you start, you won't be able to stop until episode 10 of season 7, at which point you'll be crying because the series has ended), I would have to wholeheartedly advocate the series as one of the best you'll ever see. Watch it, NOW."
738,I have never watched a movie or a TV series that let you live among characters at the level this series does. Excellent except being too short and fast moving at times. I don't think the book is very special but the film making is. I give credit to the film director and the crew. I wish they make more TV series like this one. I remember people kept the ratings at 7.5 until the 5 th episode and suddenly lot of fans are born. I was giving this 10 stars from the day 1. The story builds enough tension for you to be very fearful. At the same time some joy. But mostly keep you on the edge. There is few magic around here but mostly this is close to reality. It was a pleasure to experience this saga.
739,"As a fan of HBO and the fantasy genre, I thought this show would be a sure-thing, alas I was wrong. Despite the universal acclaim the show is getting, I find it rather dull, boring and inconsistent. There are moments of brilliance that are too-often followed by nonsensical or badly written scenes. The Imp is a great character, by far the most interesting of the bunch, so much so that he makes the rest of the characters seem like dull archetypes. The show is also very sexist and gratuitous, and I'm no prude or overt feminist, I'm also a man. The plot line with the princess being more-or-less raped over and over again who then learns how to have sex more efficiently to please the man in question, now it seems she is in love with this man and happy about having his child.... yeah I don't think that's a very convincing or morally sound character arc. Between that, and scenes that occur for no natural reason other than plot advancement, I don't think its a great show. The production values are astounding, as you would expect from HBO, and the acting is great for the most part, so I' say it's slightly above average despite my complaints. I seem to be in a minority in not thinking this show is a masterpiece so I would have to recommend it for others to try for themselves."
740,"Full disclosure: I have not read any of the books, and this is the first time I am experiencing this narrative.

Based on the high praise here on IMDb, and a personal recommendation from a friend, I have given GoT a try. I must say that I am not overly impressed. At the end of each episode, I feel slightly disappointed, as if this show has the potential to be great, but always seems to fall short somehow. My impression after watching five episodes: GoT is basically a manufactured (and predictable) cliffhanger narrative based in a fantasy realm, full of unnecessary sex and violence, that seems tacked on because that is what is 'fashionable' at the moment.

Now I know what you are thinking. You think that I am some sort of prude or puritan or something. That could not be further from the case. I have no problem with sex or violence, no matter how explicit, if it furthers the narrative. That just does not seem to be the case here.

It is not a bad show by any means. But it is also not a 9.5 show."
741,"The best TV series I have watched, I have read. I liked the book very much too.

First of all, they made the Series were very similar to the book. I can say, it is the best about that.

First season was a season which prepare the main scenario, thats why second season is better than first season, a little bit. The series is getting more excellent by every season.

Actors were good.

There weren't effects very much expect blood and scar effects, but we don't need effects very much already.

I will not write about scenario because the series translated from a book, if I review it, I will review the book, not the GoF."
742,"The best tv show ever, I've never seen anything like this before."
743,Best drama ever seen i have been watched for more than 3 times
744,From beginning to where we are now you feel like a part of Westeros. 10 out of 10. Two thumbs up.
745,"All I can say about GOT is that, the problem with Game of Thrones is nothing compares once you've watched it then rewatched it, then rewatched it and then read the books!! Everything else feels a bit flat and a bit of a let down! 🐉🐺"
746,"GoT, definitely set a new set of standards for any future television Film. The production quality is top noth! The way that characters evolve/develop is remarkable. Such a master piece!"
747,I love this show. Everything about this show is awesome.
748,Best series I've laid my eyes on. All round amazing
749,"TOP 1 serial 2011-2019, nothing to say more about it, sad that it will end this year"
750,"There is not one TV Show that can equal GOT by far the number one Show ever.

Can not wait for the Climax but its going to be very bloody for sure.

The Casting is good as is the Directing and mindblowing Special Effects.

I own Season 1-7 and I Am gonna watch them one more time till Season 8 begins.

I hope the Starks and Khaleesi come out as Winners 😀"
751,"GOT raised the standards of television series in such a way, be it in terms of any any aspect, the plot, VFX, fantasy, action.etc. that any show that I watch or at least try to, hardly live up to my expectations. This is I would say, the best series I ever saw or the best show made till date. Each and every character has been worked upon beautifully, certain characters whom you might hate initially, end up being one of your favourite characters. With the 8th season on the way, I would recommend now is the ideal time to binge this. Just give it a GO..."
752,I watched nearly half a seasoned straight until 5 am simply because I could not stop.
753,Best Quality+best acting + best writing + best show ever in the history of cinema
754,"The 7th season was a little disapointment , i actually loved watching it but aferwards i didn't felt like last seasons it was i'm watching a drama movie."
755,My words cant even explain how much i love this show
756,"What can I say..it's the best TV show that I've ever seen. The plot, the characters, the settings, the dialogues..everything is top notch. The gory and nude scenes are well crafted. Overall it's an amazing experience. Some people said the last couple of seasons are a bit dissapointing. I beg to differ. Season 6 has 2 of the best episodes in Battle of the Bastards and Winds of Winter. Season 7 is amazing with all the reunions of the Stark kids, first encounter of the main casts and the incredible war scenes. It's gonna be really hard to top this show..and I'm lookin forward to the final season.."
757,"Impeccable series in all topics. perfect adaptation. nice choose of actors and actresses. really good script with so many plot twists and all of them was made in a so good manner. perfect timing. we see the quality of the effects increasing due the success of the series but, even then, good choices to keep the story flowing in a way that you don't want to stop seeing. congratulations. perfect!"
758,"Just Mind Blowing, WOW, and a true Masterpiece. There is nothing more that I can praise that hasn't been said on here already. An epic tale of the struggle between good and evil.Game of Thrones is stunningly beautiful and a work of art out of the ordinary. Rarely have I been so moved by a movie / series. A must not only for those who enjoy a fantastic medieval adventure, but also for those who wish to be blown away by a brilliant storyline, strong characters, unexpected twists, beautiful scenery, captivating dialogue, fast paced action scenes... I could go on forever. You will hate the evil characters and love the good ones, or the contrary if you wish. To feel such strong feelings for the characters in a movie / series is the ultimate proof of what masterpiece Game of Thrones really is."
759,"In my dictionary the definition of a great movie or TV show is that, it must surprise me or must have something that worth watching... And this show surprised me in every episode even though there was nothing to be surprise of! It's worth to watch every episode of this epic TV show..! Simply awesome!"
760,"Very intriguing and the most binge worthy show ever. My favourite show ever as the world is so vast and brilliant. From characters like Joffrey and Littlefinger and even minor characters like yoren and bronn have their own background and story you can invest in. I strongly recommend this show to anyone who has never seen it and have to say that even Breaking Bad is trumped by this show. Not only is there interesting characters and even more interesting story lines there is also Dragons and White Walkers. My personal favourite characters are the villains such as both the boltons and Karl Tanner and of course Joffrey but my favourite character is arguably the hero of the show,Jon Snow.I very strongly recommend anyone to try this show. As I watched the first 4 seasons in just a week."
761,"Exactly what my summary says... Seriously, I could go on for hours about how great this show is and how just mind blowing it is. First of all it is based off of the series of books titled ""A song of Ice and Fire"" by George R R Martin. These books are better than the show (like most books are) but this is one of the best adaptations of a book that I have ever seen. First things first the acting. The portrayal of these characters and the actors and actresses that play that have an immense amount of talent. Even the children on the show know how to act and that just creates this show. The special effects are top notch and everything looks extremely realistic! The set design is beautiful, just to see this whole other world is truly amazing. The script is sophisticated and it comes together perfectly. And after all those amazing compliments its really hard to find a negative thing about this show because the twists and turns it creates always will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more!!!! This is another one of my MUST WATCH shows because its one of a kind. Even though the nudity can get a little out of hand at points this show is one of the greatest shows of all time. I recommend this!"
762,"Game of Thrones is a great series to follow up, specially when it highlights the importance of our past and history. The character engage and show how the settlement and growth of the ion throne is caught. The lifestyle stands in the evolution. The royalty of the movie is well done how it shows the social stratification. At the end my rating is 10/10 and would tell the director and actors to keep up the good work from Canada. The other thing i would like to point out is however game of throne does it , they make the series end with this feeling of you wanting to watch and want to wonder what will happen the episode after. They should correlate the kings like Khalisi with Joffrey. Seriously Jeffrey is such an character, which you really want to beat up and hate. They should've not killed the lord at the beginning because the lord dragged me to watch this movie. That scene was not fair at all. and also the Son of the lord and the wife of the lord. They should've kept creating more troops and army to takeover and make the Lanisters suffer. I really wonder which time period does this movie aim at, and also they should really have a better sense of geography. locations are very important, and that is barely shown in the movie. The movements are very important. and it's very hard to find out.

Thanks

Great series to watch. One of my favourites."
763,"Game of Thrones is a must see for fans of all genres, especially those of Fantasy, Adventure and well directed Dramas. If you are a fan of titles such as Lord of the Rings or Spartacus then I would recommend for you to watch this even more as it is essentially a mix between the two just with more drama and even better written dialog.

The show contains a great amount of incredible acting from new actors and ones you may have already heard of. Their performance however is greatly aided by the fantastic writers who make the show very excitable and thrilling.

So grab your popcorn and beverage friends as you get ready to watch one of the best shows ever to be produced and shown on television."
764,"This series got it all, every episode you don't know what's going to happen. The acting is great the Visuals are outstanding and more. You hate ore you love a char. somethimes you hate one at first and then it turns that's a great experience. You never get borred because thare a lot of plots and a lot of char. and every year you got a new char. The fights and the sneaky plots i love the most but every one can see that it's much more than only that. I hope they can keep me surprise every time with something that happens wat you don't expect. I hope they can keep it up. I read the books and it's really interesting to see wat the differends are with the books and the TV series. There are a few things differend but it doesn't bother my (normely it does). If you are twisting and turning to watch this show i you don't know yet i just say watch a few episodes and you will be hooked on this one. That's why i think this TV series is one of the best maby the best TV series ever !!! Can't wait for more of these TV series."
765,"I am out of words for this series. This is the best that was ever made and I am saying that after I have watched almost all of the high rated sitcoms. I loved FRIENDS but nothing come close enough to this George R.R. Martin masterpiece. It open your eyes and makes you realize the truth of Kingdom era in almost any part of the world. The world is full of shrewd, mean politics, people filled with lust and twisted loves. It may sound cynical to few but in spite of being classified as a Fiction, nothing can better depict the true human nature. I am loving this series so much that I started reading the novel from season 2 onwards and found that the book is even more intriguing than the series itself (as is the case with almost all of the great novels). Still I can't wait for season 3 and watching what I read in the book on the screen."
766,"Very pleased with the first season very like real life (ahaha)

Though this reminds me how sad this story was.

PROS The center of the book Tyron Lannister is a real HIT in the series CONS the wolves are more second world war German pets to me hope the dragons wil save the non-human reputation...

Hope the rest of the troup will keep on playing a few more seasons

Worst case scenario would be a success, with all of us waiting for the word the END written on paper in 2021

Or even worst, worst... audience failure...Martin commits suicide and a No End Book AWFUL !!!

Hail to the North !!!

With some chance, this could be the Harry Potter Saga for those over 30 with a princess in the foot and knight in the ankle.

Let's Enjoy what it lasts."
767,"After hearing a lot of hype involved with this recent new series that HBO released, I decided to check it out for myself. Having read the first two books in the series (Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings), I was curious as to how true to the ""feel"" of the first book would transpose to ten 50-55 minute blocks. Like previous reviewers have noted, most attempts at visually bringing a book to life are usually met with dire results or fail to live up to expectations for the whole season. However, I can say with absolute certainty that this series has lived up to that hype and more.

Everything from the casting to the dialogue and non-verbal imagery to the set designs are spot-on to how Martin described each environment in his book. Sean Bean, Lena Headyey, Emilia Clarke, and Peter Dinklage, among the other fine actors, do a superb job of making their characters their own, especially Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion (my favorite character of the book series so far). The environments capture the air of tense conflict as the story unfolds in each episode, and the dialogue, although not always delivered well with some of the characters, was refreshing to hear overall. It was nice to see each actor take their respective roles very seriously.

Some folks would complain about the amount of nudity, sexuality, and gore seen throughout the series. I respond by simply saying that they perhaps toned it down a bit from much of what is described in the books and that those folks should be grateful that they aren't visually representing the book in this fashion TO THE WORD. Still, this is a series for mature audiences and if sex, gratuitous violence, and bloodshed aren't your cup of tea, I would stay away from this series, both on HBO and in the books.

Overall, this is a great adaptation to George R. R. Martin's first book in his epic series and I cannot wait to see what they do for the next season's adventure ""A Clash of Kings."""
768,"George R R Martin, has done quite a job with his series of books, based around the 7 kingdoms and the fight for the iron Throne. All I can say is thank goodness HBO got the rights to film this and not a bunch of pansies who would have made this into a watered down shadow of it's rightful self. This is war, this is death, this is sex and violence and family feuds and long held memories. It is fantasy and drama and comedy and wine and song. I will admit the acting isn't always perfect, and the budget forbids grandiose battle scenes or a cast of thousands! But still Martin's vision shines through, the story is compelling to any fan of LOTR , you know who you are, it also appeals to any medievalists or people who dreamed of lands beyond this Earth. I am waiting the next season, and I truly hope this series gains in popularity and word of mouth until the whole saga has been translated onto screen. Down with the Lannisters!"
769,"After two years of waiting, GOT came with a mediocre opening to continue the disaster they made in season seven. The script and conversations between the characters was bad comparing to previous seasons, the green screen and visual effects specially when they ride the dragons was poor. Moreover, the soundtrack wasn't as good as it used to be."
770,"I prefer to watch series in one piece. It is nice to see how seies are changing and mostly getting better after 1 or 2 years. Thos was the case in GoT too. So I enjoyed the first seasons, especielly season 3 and 4 and maybe the 5th season also, I cant remember. Season 6 was a annoying, because the roles of men were ridiculous and there were so many women ruling and deciding. The reason is obvious, politics decides movies also, not logic of a story. It is so easy to get rid of a female enemy in a middle age setting: a man doesnt even need a weapon. I dont know, if I will watch the 7th season, probably not."
771,"Definitely one of the best fantasy series ever. I don't think I ever saw a better one. At least I can't remember a better one. I write this after the seventh season and it's still as good as the beginning. That's says it all. The acting is excellent. There are so many different characters, clans and families that it could be difficult to follow if you didn't pay attention. But all the characters are worth watching, every single one of them. And don't get too attached to a character because it could be over for him or her in any episode. Never saw so many main characters being killed or murdered as in Game Of Thrones. And that's a real good thing because there is always an element of surprise. In every season characters that you would think will survive die. The battles are epic, the story could go in any direction anytime. Betrayals, violence, conquests, incestuous affairs, the show has everything. I'm a devoted fan, so devoted I already have three tattoos about it. House Targayen rules!"
772,"It's an amazing show filled with great scenery and characters alike. The plot is realistic while still being fantasy.

These last seasons are rushed but they're still brilliantly done in terms of costume and action.

Yes the show is brutally violent but, it's fantasy plus, the medieval ages weren't elegant times anyway. Even today it's pretty violent.

Excellent show, a must watch!"
773,"Saying it's the greatest show in the world, is an understatement to this masterpiece show by HBO. Everyhing from the writing to production and visuals are just amazing and unlike anything you have seen before.

Great quality through out the series, with amazing plot twists and character deaths that is impossible to predict. Truly the best show that has ever been made. All thanks to the amazing geniuses involved."
774,"When Game of Thrones first came out in 2011, I was the first to pay for HBO when it came with my Fios ultimate package and have never missed an episode since thanks to DVR and on demand showings of the show. Sometimes I even fall asleep watching it first run and watch it again. The show is one of the best on TV, being better than any movie blockbuster out there. The first few seasons are based on the best selling books by George R.R. Martin, with future seasons borrowing elements from the last few and upcoming books. It's a shame that this season and the next, which will air in 2019, will be short yet satisfying. Game of Thrones is to HBO what The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad is to AMC and The West Wing is to NBC; great television that will be talked about in the water-cooler for years to come. Winter has been here for seven and eight seasons and will last forever."
775,"I'm a big fan of the work, read all the books of A Song of Ice and Fire and come here to make a brief review of what I think of the series.

The first season was very good (maybe because I had not read the book and everything was new), but from there, the producers began to change and omit details not so important, but with no need.

The actors and scenery were well chosen, I feel the show when I'm reading the book and vice versa.

Although the median score, the work deserves a production height, the height on a budget, of course this show was a good start, but I cheer that it won't be the definitive work.

In short, 10 for the books, 7 for the show."
776,"This show is probably one of my favorite shows of all time. I even started reading the books and guess what! The show is almost completely identical. I don't know what people are talking about when they say it is leaving out a lot of stuff. Yes, there is stuff being left out but stuff that is not really necessary to put in the show.

Also, a lot of people are saying this show has way too much sex and I don't know what they are talking about. You want to see a show with a lot of sex? Watch Spartacus. That is a show with a lot of sex and it is way more graphic.

The story is amazing. It puts you on edge and always makes you wonder what is going to happen. The characters are really well written and the actors they chose for them are perfect.

I just think a lot of people are uncomfortable with sex and violence. If that is the case, this show isn't for you. If you don't mind seeing some sex scenes, a few disturbing scenes(one?), fantasy, amazing character designs, and amazing cinematography then this show is perfect for you. I love it and I think it is amazingly written.

I am just going to say again, THIS SHOW IS NO WHERE NEAR PORNOGRAPHY."
777,I finished in episode 3 of season 1 because this show sucks
778,"The reason people are giving this series so many stars is because of the sex scenes. That's all people care about this day. People being naked, people having sex, and killing. You don't have to have all of that in a show to make it good. If you want to watch people having sex or nudity then watch this show, but I don't recommend it for people who love their families and actually care about what they watch. And I don't need to see the series to know this."
779,"By far Got is the most amazing series i've ever seen..The plot is so well-played and the characters are so incredible actors/actresses!!! I am surprised by the customs, the scenes, the graphics...I hope this show continue entertains us with the amazing way it does...I highly recommended it to all those people who are in love with agony...It is just perfect!!!"
780,don't waste another second go and watch it HBO's epic hit fantasy is the best show I've seen take it show by which I mean 2 seasons a day only 60 episodes and season 7 comes July 17th at 9 pm British standard time any character could die at any given moment my personal favourite of the show is Daenerys or Robb stark I've watch the whole series and if you get the chance read the books they are just as good
781,"First of all, hats off to George R. R. Martin who created this amazing imaginary perfect world and to the show-runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for making us able to live the epic events of this world through the screen. It's hard to find something that could beat the intense of this TV show. If you're a fan of the fantasy genre, believe me you don't wanna miss this. With its horror of telling the story of a brutal world where you can barely survive in, with its mind blowing plot twists and turn of events, game of thrones has earned the hype. I recommend it so badly, go for it guys, you cannot afford to miss it."
782,"With out of doubt, this is the best show that has ever been and ever will be. The writing, acting, directing and so on. Everything about it is just to good to be true. This show is a masterpiece sent from heaven for us to see.

Great music, visual effect and lots of great dialog, twist and turns and battles. HBO is known for making the best dramas in the world and this is the best it can get. Not a dull moment in the series, every single scene is amazingly written and performed by the wonderful actors.

Can't wait for upcoming spin offs HBO are working on. Best show in the world, no doubt."
783,"You want The Throne ? You don't have to fight for it. You have to play a game - A Game of Thrones. Written by George R.R. Martin, this one-of-a- kind series has all you will want - action,adventure,philosophy,fantasy,supernatural,horror, it has it all. If you say you watch series but not Game of Thrones, you have never really watched a true one..."
784,"This show is very good, though it needs some better writing - esp. in S7. Production should get its stuff together - molten gold is WHITE hot! I don't care if it is cheaper to use yellow water! Get this common trope trope out of fantasy (molten copper /alloys/ that is ready for casting is another example)! The fight scenes need some expert advise. The main cast needs archery lessons. The extras shouldn't throw their punches into thin air. Yes, nice locations and that... but yellow water - ""Dothraki gold"" ruins that for me.

I want slight reduction of on-screen brutality and more non-sterile nudity/sex instead."
785,"Intense and interesting chapter, not as spectacular as the previous one. In this one. Daenerys after fierce ultimatums (that are resolved by eliminating everybody who opposes her will), she realizes that you can not go through life asking everyone to bow before her. Cersei intends to match the number of dragons with own sons and in front of the whimsical Daenerys a Jon Snow too humble and soft; it is a shame the loss of some characters like Leena Tyrell."
786,"GOT has been consistently good from the start. It is proof positive that heroic fantasy (or Sword & Sorcery) can be mature entertainment without descending to a Xena-like result.

Midway through the third or fourth episode I suddenly realised that one of the genre's icons, none other than Conan of Cimmeria, would benefit from the GOT treatment. Conan, woefully misrepresented by a certain Mr Schwarzenegger, really needs to find a new audience and a regular show might be just the ticket.

Come on Robert E Howard's estate - make it happen.

Anyone else agree?"
787,the best of the best game of thrones i wish the directors to make another serial like this it is a wonderful an epic we hope to have a good end to make us happy and not to make us wonder and not to live us with a questions i have already look the serial tree times you are never boring to watch it
788,"This is the most fascinating show for ever. No need to say much about this show, many have spoken already. It is just to say, me too participated in the review.

Continuous Thrill, Surprises and the most haunting question is ""Who is Next""!!! It is certainly not the show to watch with family members except wife, but brothers with brothers n sisters with sisters. Off-course with friends, it is an ultimate entertaining.

Every thing in this show, Action perfection, themes, scenes, script phrases, quotes... Especially every scene of IMP made me to glow to this show. He is the real hero of this show."
789,"If you are looking to watch a quality T.V. show with good acting, great screenplay, and amazing scenes with detailed character, well, you have come to the right place.

This show has you follow multiple people per episode so it isn't set to just one person or place. You follow very well thought out characters across a world with two continents and many different kingdoms, hence ""Game of Thrones"".

Many different characters come and go so you will always being on the edge of your seat seeing who lives or dies. Some of the episodes end abruptly which leaves a cliffhanger for the next episode which makes you want to watch even more.

Next to the interesting plots and characters, there is a vast amount of blood, murder, sex, nudity, and witchcraft to keep you entertained. Although this is not the entire show, these all make a broad statement when watching.

There are very little, if any, television shows that amount to the level of ""Game of Thrones"". 10/10 would recommend to anyone."
790,"They say Great things come in small packages and in the case of Peter Dinklage that could not be more true, every small nuance of Peter Dinklage in games of thrones is nothing short of Genius actor who can capture the moment and make me appreciate the art of role playing, the cast is very talented but i was hypnotize by his role and the way he carry out the story line ,not many people can understand the difficulty of casting a serious role due to his measurement but for me he is the tallest actor in the cast and the one who i enjoy the most. i thank the production for casting him and i hope to see more of this little genius on the big screen.

best regards Ilan more"
791,"awesome series i have ever watched The series is set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos and interweaves several plot lines with a large ensemble cast. The first narrative arc follows a dynastic conflict among competing claimants for succession to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from it; the second covers the attempts to reclaim the throne by the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty; the third chronicles the rising threat of the impending winter and the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North. Game of Thrones has attracted record numbers of viewers on HBO and attained an exceptionally broad and active international fan base. It has received widespread acclaim by critics, particularly for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity, violence, and sexual violence has attracted criticism."
792,"I was blown away by this show from start to finish. I couldn't believe how rich and spectacular the visuals were, how first-rate and technically marvelous the entire production was. But as much if not more so than the production itself, the intricate story lines and deeply complex characters make this show how deservedly popular and lauded it is. Rarely has there been a medieval, fantasy epic this rife with feeling, passion, betrayal, slaughter, and downright twists and turns. With a terrific ensemble cast and special effects that make the most expensive Hollywood blockbusters look unimpressive, ""Game of Thrones"" has left its mark on the zeitgeist as the show to beat in television history."
793,"I understand that George R. R. Martin based ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" on various and sundry wars and conquests throughout Europe's history. Indeed, the characters on ""Game of Thrones"" seem to have no aim except to fight for control of Westeros. It is as though their quest for prestige has become an excuse to spend eternity fighting.

I should note that this show is not for children. It's one of the most violent shows that I've ever seen. Seriously, they leave little to the imagination. I've never read the books on which the series is based, but the series doesn't dumb anything down (understanding of course that it's fantasy).

Having just binge-watched the first season, I recommend the show. Really impressive."
794,"As I await season 3, this show has been posted as the 'top user rated TV series of 2012' while I thoroughly enjoy most episodes I have found one thing in particular lacking... meaningful battle scenes.. we have seen armies sweep across the fabled land of Westeros while rarely seeing them draw a sword in anger, this show is in effect a 'medieval' soap opera with occasional glimpses of the real action, my main issue with this is that the program demands more action and on a much grander scale and in reality it pretends to have these set pieces in abundance which is a little bit of hype on the part of the producers. Anyone who wants to see epic battle sequences will be bitterly disappointed. I can only hope that in this coming season we will actually see more of these 'wars' played out on the battlefield rather than focusing completely on the aftermath of battles or the reactions of various noblemen."
795,"Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land ...

Filmatic medieval-like TV series, with high production a values and quality acting.

Despite some seemingly inconsistencies with the language in the script the characters are finely portrayed. The lead cast are an array of familiar faces from both TV and film, a mix that has become synonymous with TV series recently, Game of Thrones includes Sean Bean and Lena Headey to name a few. Notable is actor Peter Dinklage who wonderfully portrays Tyrion Lannister. The characters are shades of grey, the story is vast and bravely take it's time to unfold probably thanks to George R.R. Martin's novel source material.

The locations, costumes and set are fantastic and capture both the richness and squallier of the fictional period creating an atmosphere you can taste and feel.The bloody and gritty first episode successfully set the tone for the series. Game of Thrones is certainly a milestone in TV entertainment."
796,"I have watched every episode of this intriguing, beautifully done series. I am very impressed with the top quality acting that comes across with every person in the series. I am particularly fond of Peter Dinklage and Jack Gleeson (King Joffrey). They are definitely a notch above spectacular. Jack Gleeson should become famous after this show, this kid is extremely talented. He is playing his bad guy part to the hilt. I put him in the class of Jason Issacs of Braveheart and Alan Rickman as Sheriff of Notingham in the Kevin Costner Robin Hood movie. He does such despicable acts with the glee and enjoyment much like Alan Rickman. I would love to see him do many different roles, to display talents for all types of films. Good luck to you, what a future you have Mr. Gleeson."
797,"This series has a story that unravels piece by piece, and gives time for the characters to develop and show their acting! The actors excel in every scene and the story keeps you glued to the TV. It is really the best series i have ever seen, it has action and the storyline is great. It's difficult to describe how good it is, the scenarios are deep and bring us to forget day to day life. It is way better than a Lord of the Rings version series, it's story is richer and more compelling, has less action, but it's story compensates. I compare it with Battlestar Galactica or Stargate Atlantis, that were well written and produced, but i think this one could be better. Pros: Actors, Storyline , well produced, action! I think the producers prove themselves as genius not in movies but only in series, as it is a lot more difficult to keep a great audience for a long time, and this one could be one of those!!"
798,"It contains sex,war and all the primitive stuff that attracts us.But it also contains culture,intelligence,fantasy,psychology,mind games,and everything that makes a film great.Thank you producers!This is the kind of movie that pulls you out from the outside world deep,deep into the fantasy.During the 60 minutes that it lasts,you will not think of real life problems or something else.It is beautiful,thank you!"
799,"I was looking forward to the new HBO series ""Game of Thrones"". I have been disappointed by Camelot and have missed the boldness of Spartacus. I am a huge fantasy and period piece fan and had high hopes for this fantasy, since I was told it had great characters and great scope. I am also a fan of Sean Bean for his LOTR's portrayal of Boromir and other movies. I've tried to get into this series but I just can't. I don't understand how any of these people have survived; they just go around killing each other. No one is smart except the dwarf and Dean's youngest daughter but alas the dwarf has become just another repetitive idiot and the little girl is a minor character that you hardly ever see. It's just not an interesting story. I bought the book which I might read. Maybe the written story will be better. This is a real disappointment for a fan of history piece and fantasy. There is not fantasy in it just endless people looking ugly and sad.3/10"
800,"First 4 seasons were amazing, seasons 5 to know Simply suck and it almost looks as if they only do fan-service story lines. First 4 seasons a solid 9/10 after that a high 3/10. All in all a 6/10."
801,"This show got me sitting for a whole day on a chair my PC before me without taking my eyes off of the screen until i finished the 6 seasons in just a week.i enjoyed it,i enjoyed every episode,every season,every scene,every part of it. okay now i gotta mention the one thing that got me in awe,and it was the acting,the great performance and the getting fully into the character. after that,comes the scenario which is based on the books written by George R.R Martin and i haven't read them but i bet they were real page turners. the scenario couldn't be better, the dialogues mixed with a little bit of drama and theater ,which made it look perfect. in a brief conclusion,it is the best show i've ever watched until now. so for those out there who didn't have the chance to watch it,just get it done already,i promise you won't regret. PS:if you are a student and you're willing on going for it,just make sure you don't have any exams coming for a week or so.just saying...."
802,"I have read the books and looked forward to the series. George RR Martin was a recommendation of a friend of mine along with a woman named Hobb. Hobb had to wait due to the immediacy of my addiction. I was somewhat let down in the first episode. Now I can say nothing more than: so far, it is merely watchable. The books sucked me in and held me due to the amount of detail and immersion in the storyline. The characters came to life, leaving you wanting more and more. This series lacks the character development needed to achieve the same effect. I hold hope that once the cast are at war and the starks and cohorts are on the move, things will pick up, but I grow more and more skeptical. The imp is spot on, though. I think if they played the book out a bit more on film, they would have an epic."
803,"One of the best TV serial in Hollywood history. One of the best thing in Game of thrones is they have only 10 episodes per season (except Season 7&8). A year of waiting for each and every season, its really thrilling experience. Game of thrones: 1- Best casting 2- Best Making 3- Best CGI and VFX 4- Best THEME Music (Title card) 5- Overall Best TV serial history.

When u r waiting for the next season, everyone those who read Book make theories for the next episode, it is really interesting ... kind of made everyone happy, especially when Jon Snow died and came back to life.. :)

When u heard last season will take two years to telecast, that's the real pain. :("
804,"Maybe. This Show is amazing (except for Bran's storyline which is just rather boring) but I ignore that because the rest of the show is fantastic. There is a beautiful mix between violence, intrigue, story, and a little humor. I have never felt a real hate for anybody in any film medium as I have whilst watching this show, and I have never felt as much stress and been on the edge of my seat as I have during this show. Even the fourth and fifth seasons (which weren't as good as the others) were better than anything else I have watched. With the film industry going downhill, it is refreshing to see that television is getting better and better. And this show is at the forefront."
805,"Total snoozefest. Utterly boring and a waste of acting talent, set design, music...etc. Here's a little secret on how to watch this series: Watch the first 2 minutes where they explain what happened in the previous episode. Fast forward to the final 10 minutes (it's the only part of the show where anything happens) and watch the final 10 minutes. Rinse and repeat. I plan on watching every episode in one sitting. Should take about 2 hours."
806,"I've seen 5 episodes so far and I'm contemplating on giving up.

I mean this series is just boring. It's the same thing chewed over and over again.

Each episode has some brutal fighting with someone beheaded or loosing their eye before dying. It looks like an awful clone of MK fatalities. Then out of the blue there's sex and swearing. I mean, What the Freak?!!! What makes you people rank this 9.5 of 10? IT IS LOUSY AND PATHETIC... I'm sorry, this series just sucks... The only thing worth of watching is the midget guy. I don't really remember his name but I've been admiring him since the infamous ""In Brugges"" and his ""... There's war coming. ... And you won't have to pick a side..."""
807,"People brainwashed, so watching every popular thing. Popular in 2010-2019 = trash."
808,"This show is a thrilling roller-coaster ride, with so many twists and unexpected events.

Every episode brings something new to the table and it is so good. To anyone waiting out on this show... Go watch it. Believe me it's worth it.

I cant wait to see what the rest of this show brings! My score for Game of Thrones: 10/10"
809,"With many shows and movies about post-apocalyptic futuristic societies, George Martin's Game of Thrones is a refreshing change. It is a stunning mix of fantasy, drama, and medieval warfare. The book series turned TV show is truly audience engaging with its great cast, attention to fine details, and suspenseful storyline. The cast of a show either makes or breaks it, in Game of Thrones the cast definitely makes the show. Before the end of the first episode, the audience can't help getting attached to certain characters and hating others. One character that the audience can't help but hate is Prince Joffrey, who attacks a helpless boy who is pretend sword fighting. After Joffrey gets hurt he has his father, the King, order to have the boy killed. A character that viewers can't help but love is Arya, the daughter of the King's best friend. Arya doesn't follow the social norms set for girls, she wants to learn how to fight, be rough, and ride horses like her brothers. When caught pretend sword fighting with her friend she fights back against the Prince not caring about his status. Jack Gleeson and Maisie Williams bring these characters to life. Without the amazing actors and cast there wouldn't be a huge following of the show, which includes over seven million people who watch the show just on TV not including those who watch online. The details are an important part of any book, movie or show. This show is no different because there are so many small details that could easily be forgotten. One would think that the style of clothing, type of armor, or even silverware used to eat wouldn't make a different in watching the show, but it truly does. The clothing distinguishes the poor from the rich, and those who live in warm climates in the south from those in the north in the cold. The armor displays that someone is a knight, or a war soldier. The silverware exhibits financial status. Each noble family in the kingdom has their own personal symbol, and when they travel or go to war, flags with the symbol are carried with them. These details didn't come without extreme cost .When watching it is easy to understand why it costs over five million dollars to film each episode. It probably would have been easier to film in front of a green screen, but that would have taken away from the authenticity of the story. The show is filmed in authentic locations all around Europe from Iceland, Spain, Croatia, Ireland, to Malta. When reading a book or watching a movie, it is usually easy to predict the ending. It often times ends when the boy gets the girl and they live happily ever after. This does not happen in Game of Thrones. All sixty minutes of each episode is action packed. It is nearly impossible to predict a certain character's fate because of the action packed scenes and suspense, even if they seem like a main character. When watching the audience can't help but sit on the edge of their seat not knowing what's going to happen. When past events are tied to recent event, it creates a ""ah ha"" moment that helps viewers understand a certain character's actions in the past. What makes Game of Thrones great is that it is truly unique, with the use of mystical animals. However, a comparable show is Vikings, in both shows the goal is to become King by overcoming numerous obstacles. If you're looking for a show that is action packed, and full of suspense then Game of Thrones is the show for you. Full of great actors with whom the audience can't help but form an emotional attachment to. The attention to fine details creates a sense of authenticity of how the people in the kingdom live. A major point to consider when watching is that no one is ever safe. It never turns out the way the audience anticipates, the future can never be predicted. It will leaving you with a cliffhanger ending."
810,"First of all I would like to say that I have not read the book so how much it stays true to the books is not something I have considered. With that being out of the way I am a huge fan of fantasy stories, mostly high fantasy but also low fantasy.

Game of Thrones although considered high fantasy feels a lot like low fantasy in the sense that it is not so much about fantasy creatures such as dragons and orcs, although those do exist, but rather much more about political intrigues of various powerful families and in that sense reminded me more about medieval times and how the monarchies fought each other.

However Game of Thrones is set in an imaginary world and definitely has supernatural elements so in effect it could be the perfect mix of fantasy and realistic story. And although the series is quite good I feel it falls short in two key areas.

One is that it often feels anti-climactic. Many of the important key plots are often concluded in a very short time, after a very long and slow buildup, which for me has left me quite unsatisfied. I can't go into details as that would be a spoiler but let's just say that there are things that you have waited for the entire season, just to finish quickly and with a whimper rather than a bang.

The second key area where it fails are the battles. Most of the them situations are resolved very quickly and in many times not even shown at all. Rather it is built up slowly, sometimes over several episodes, and once it actually happens you don't see anything! Rather it is just explained, after the fact, what the outcome was. I think, after watching three seasons, I saw one battle which was satisfying to watch and even that comes nowhere near the epic battles of movies like Lord of the Rings or even Spartacus (the series).

And for a fantasy story, be it high or low, it is inexcusable to have such poor battle depiction and the main reason why I scored it a 7 rather than a 9."
811,I have never been so obsessed with a show and characters in my LIFE until I started watching game of thrones. And discovered the massive crush I have on Emilia Clarke. 😂😂 but it is really amazing! Don't trust the bad reviews.
812,"Cant deny it, this is the only show that are watchable eventhough some of it episode look boring, but everything is very highly quality from the cast performance, storyline and the special effects. Highly recommend for someone who not watch this yet. Warning; not suitable for children as it has a highly violence scene."
813,"If you haven't seen Game of Thrones, you are denying yourself the opportunity to watch one of the greatest shows ever created. It tops everything, in my humble opinion, and is a masterpiece."
814,"Game of Thrones isn't about good people fighting bad people. Its about individual human hearts. so many character you can choose to be your main/fav character, depends on your perspective. This is the abnormal way to feel and enjoy a flim."
815,"If you have a job, school,..... then don't watch this TV show, simply it will take your mind away, you will have a headache from the greatness of the performance, it will take you heart, it will make you love the historical art and tha fantasy movies, tv shows. It is perfect for the beginners or regulars viewers, it will teach him/her how to review or judge on the performance. This tv show is a mentor to the seventh art."
816,I was late on the scene to watch game of thrones. But one episode in and I couldn't stop. I watched all seven seasons in one hit and having withdrawals waiting for the next to air. It's fantastic to say the least.
817,"I am writing this because according to the IMDB User Ratings, I have not commented. I have reviewed all the individual episodes, but not the show as a whole. There is little that I can add to the impact of this show. I am proud to be on the same planet as those who created and put this work into fruition. When one looks at the technical accomplishments and the multiple plot strains that have been kept in balance, it is truly a wonder. I know that there are those who can never get past the ""book did this"" and ""the book did that."" We have to come to realize that it is impossible to recreate every nuance that fiction allows and that occasionally characters must be dropped and events assumed. For me, I have approached these as the artistic creations they are--as film (and television, at that). I have the books. I've not read them but plan to at some point. I doubt at this late stage of my life there will ever be another series to match this. I like fantasy but am not ruled by it as a genre. But this is for us all. If you've not seen it, treat yourself."
818,"It is such a beautiful and uplifting twist seeing Jon Snow coming back to life! It is getting more exciting and really can't wait for more episodes. The strong characters of every individual role complement each other which will hook you up till the end. Jon Snow is the hot topic at the comeback of Season 6. He's presence making a positive view from the audience. His vital contribution to the whole story is really needed and you can't get him out.

The fact that the previously very-dead Jon Snow is now very not-dead on Game of Thrones is perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in the show's six-year history. But that didn't stop the production team from trying to keep his return under wraps—and they went to some pretty crazy lengths to do so, like banning his name.

Game of Thrones is now getting powerful, vibrant, exciting, and the game is always on!"
819,"Game of Thrones!!! Loosely based on the English War of Roses, writer Martin added many outside elements to create an awe-inspiring fantasy series. His books were adopted into TV series.

It is the political story about an in-power family and other noble families in the fantasy land of Westerros to control the continent.

This series is full of twists and turns and it is hard to fit this in a particular genre. Many moves were not on the expected lines with new surprises in every episode.

The directors leave each and every season at cliff hangers and audience has to wait almost an year to know the fate of their favorite characters.

It hold an IMDb rating of 9.5 as of now (End of Season 5), which by no means a smaller achievement. The rating it hold in IMDb tells it all!!!"
820,"When I first heard about GoT, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I hadn't previously read the books, so I knew nothing. (lol) With that said, GoT blends fantasy, action, sexuality, and a little comedy here and there. As the seasons progress, the series leans mostly toward the darker side. But never-the-less, the series is definitely one to check out! Think Lord of the Rings but on a much larger much more in-depth scale.

I will say that the violence and sexuality should be noted. GoT holds nothing back, and you will be submersed in a world of no shame or modesty.

That aside, the first season focuses mainly on one family, but eventually more characters come, and the story begins to follow several different stories in several different places all at once by bouncing back and forth, just like the book.

The story can sometimes be difficult to keep up with, with the amount of story change, and 'back and forth'-ness. This would be the only real downside. The situations each character is faced with, the action, costume and set designs, the acting, and of course the landscape all make up for that! You will be at the edge of your seat through 98% of the series, and when the season is over you will go through GoT withdraws as you beg for more!"
821,"I don't think there is much else that can be written here about this incredible series. But I thought of adding my personal angle on the experience, as I am totally, irrevocably hooked on this show and cannot wait to see the rest of it. When I first started to watch it I actually found it a bit boring. I was never a real fan of fantasy, disliked the Lord of the Rings series and thought this would not escalate on my priority list. Bt so many friends were talking about it that I thought of giving it a chance. I had a similar experience with Breaking Bad, so it was worth trying. It took 5 or 6 episodes of season 1 to get there, but very soon I became completely addicted to the show, to its characters, to its unbelievable and unpredictable twists to the point that now I am literally FEARING who, after losing so many of our beloved protagonists, will be up next. Just a fantastic show that I hope will continue for a long time and that I wish did non have such a broad hiatus between seasons."
822,"Game of Thrones is a great series, not mainly because of it's great visual effects, fast action and cinematic looks (although those are pretty good too...), but because of it's characters. They are all extremely believable and interesting, they really are the heart of this series. Should those characters be taken away, then everything collapses dramatically, for sure. Almost every line, every moment and every scene is filled with complicated and intriguing emotions and situations. With every episode the characters grow bigger and bigger, creating a realism and depth you rarely see in today's television series. The only thing that i found irritating from time to time was the fact that the environment (and perspective) changes a lot, giving you the feeling of hopping through the world, every time a scene gets really interesting, the camera hops away to another perspective. But that's a detail and doesn't nearly compare to the greatness of this series. I really recommend giving it a chance, you won't regret it!"
823,"What can I say about this series? Less is more I think in this situation. This is a literary masterpiece brought to life on the screen. George RR Martin's novels are some of my favorite books that I have ever read. And this is the cinematic experience of those books brought to life. The scenery and sets are gorgeous. The story itself is a thrill ride that will take you from peak to peak. The characters are deep, complicated, and lovable all in their own ways. Except for that bastard Joffrey... If you haven't watched it yet, please just do so. Nothing I can say here can convince you more than an hour with the series will. Just do yourself a favor, and watch this."
824,"This is an excellent drama show that I would recommend to everyone who can handle it's explicit content. Game of Thrones is produced by HBO so this should be expected. However, despite it's explicit content it is still an outstanding drama show.

Game of Thrones is a series that requires patience when it comes to plot development, despite this the show can easily hook you with cliffhangers and brilliant acting. The effort and detail put into this show visually really pays out creating a show that feels real, gripping and enthralling. This show is centred around the conflicts and interactions between the many houses in Westeros. Centering around secrets and betrayal, war and family-ties, this show is more than just a fantasy series. The highlight of this show is the interactions between it's many characters and the complexity of the plot. Because of this complexity keeping up with plot lines and characters can often get confusing, but eventually things begin to work themselves out as you watch more.

I enjoy how well the writers have adapted the novels, even with the plot lines differing in minor ways. This however, is mainly to help with the budget and also to help out the viewer since there are even more characters in the books which, if added, would likely confuse the already sprawling and complex storyline. All in all Game of Thrones is a series I highly recommend to anyone who likes a brilliant plot, fantastic actors and great writing."
825,"I cannot understand why people talk about abomination and sex and why it is bad - when placed in context. Wow. Never happened in history before at all... So that's why we are all created by God and even should make political correct shows... WTF! OMG. Get real. It's fantasy... And I never was a fan of that genre. But what some people write here is just stupidity. I mean, referring to an IQ of the people who watch a show to distract themselves and want to be entertained is just pure ignorance.

For me it's one of the best shows ever made although I prefer the books. For me, as a native German, the books are harder to understand than the show actually is, but still. Images come while reading. Yet, I have to admit that the show/series is very close to the books and the pictures match.

I always tell my friends if GoT would run for 24/7, I would take holidays for that.

Keep it going. Looking forward to season 4, although I know what's coming."
826,"""king"" is but a mere title the people are the country

The Game of Thrones received high ratings during its first season of airing, it had a story that gives life to our imagination of our childhood mythical bedtime stories.

The setting is in a medieval time where vikings were ruling the northern seas and were the most powerful in Europe during their reign. The story revolves around the (royal family) Baratheon, (overthrown royals) Targaryen, the Stark's, Lanister's, witches and gods.

GOT, first started of with the story in northern territory of the kingdom that is made up of 7 kingdoms, the story begins with Ned Stark beheading a runaway knight watch member who happens to witness the white walkers reviving the dead. The story progresses on as the late king, Robert Baratheon, dies and his wife's son who happens to be the son of Jaime Lannister who is the Queen's brother, takes over as king and beheads Ned Stark sparking a war between the Northen territory, Winterfell, who proclaimed themselves an independent kingdom after the death of Ned.

The Stark children are all separated, Arya in the good hands of people whom she meets along the way, Sansa in the royal city, Robb preparing for war with the other kingdoms who stands in his conquest of freeing them from Baratheon/Lanister rule, Jon Snow (half-blood, Stark) in the far north up beyond the wall as a Knight Watch, Bran now a limp, try to find their way back to restore their broken family.

Season 3 is much anticipated by viewers, because of the sudden climax of the appearance of the White Walkers which seem to be pretty nasty opponents. I just hope that there would be more story on Daenerys Taygaryen and her dragon children."
827,"Love, betrayal, greed, murder, corruption All collides in mythical world of Westeros. Where do I start..?

Game of Thrones, is a show like nothing before.I started to watch that and then I can't stop. I watched all seasons at a time.The cast is perfect.Costumes are great.Scene and photography are amazing.I love all of actors at the series.Specially Daenerys Targaryen.She is my favorite.

Normally you read the books, and then you watch the movie and you're so disappointed, right? Not this time,my friends.This series is great as the book.

I'm just saying; Sit back and enjoy dear friends. 'Winter is coming!'"
828,"My philosophy for the structure of a perfect movie holds true in the realm of TV shows, as Emmy Award-winning Game of Thrones brilliantly illustrates. The series transcends the simple and traditional genres of fantasy or myth as its deeply complex story and large, strong cast of rich, colorful, and layered characters convey themes that apply more often to the politics and society of today's world than the mystical Middle Ages. Once you watch Game of Thrones, you quickly lose the sense that you're watching a fantasy as you're engrossed in the characters' epic stories of a struggle for power, love, loss, betrayal, the quest for justice, identity, coming of age, and so many others. This series is truly one that can easily satisfy any and every viewer. 9.0/10"
829,"It took a lot of convincing for me to give GOT a shot. Halfway through the 1st episode I was motivated enough to spend an hour on the internet trying to understand the universe of Westeros and the relationships between the main characters. If you have not read the books then a little study can add significantly to your enjoyment of GOT. Although I enjoyed Lord of the Rings, I would not consider myself either a buff of fantasy or of the Dark/Middle Ages. Kings and castles tend to make me move on to something else. But, for me, GOT has turned out to be my favorite show currently on TV. The 1st is Breaking Bad. So if you think you may not like this program despite it's high ratings PLEASE give it a try. I hope this show gains a broad audience and can survive at least as long as Breaking Bad or the Sopranos. One last thing - GOT shows that hints of the fantastic and supernatural can be as powerful as the bazzilions of fantastical creatures that inhabited Middle Earth of LOTR."
830,"Here we go again, people walking around in animal skins that looks as though they haven't washed in months, blah blah blah blah.....

Message to author- please think of something original."
831,"After all the hype I was expecting much better from this series.. the story is slow and episodes can pass without anything happening at all.. Characters invite you to like them and then they do something stupid or they die.. i find it impossible to become emotionally attached to anyones character ( By that i mean i don't know who to support or believe in because they usually die within a few episodes of becoming central to the plot).. Its just a very frustrating series and seems to be mindlessly continuing without any real method.. Overall, 6/10 may be harsh.. Acting is great and set is even better.. but the average rating (9.4/10) is simply not right.."
832,"all these 9 and 10 reviews after 1 episodes...time for some counter-opinions...honestly, i think the series does not deliver anything new which hasn't been done in similar series such as tudors or rome or whatever...its really pretty over-hyped and all the good reviews are probably from fan boys...the storyline is pretty standard 0815 and the plot very predictable...its simply your average throne-intrigue-setting...the one thing that really annoyed me seriously was all the nudity and the fu****...sorry guys but i don't understand you Americans, usually you're extremely conservative about such stuff, but with all these medieval/fantasy/historical settings your completely overdo it with the sex stuff - and this series just completely blows it out of proportions...there is sex ALL THE TIME - seriously this series is more about sex then most porn i have watched...and that just gets boring really fast...please more action, more decapitating and less smushing"
833,Just watch it.... This show is really as amazing as everyone says.
834,"This show is my favorite tv show I've watched almost 50 shows and none of then can be compared to GOT there is everything u want in this show [Drama,Romance,Horror,etc] i suggest it to everyone new to tv show world much love thanks :D"
835,"It had a lot of fillers, too much time wasting moments and for 60 minutes runtime that's a disappointment.

I thought it would have more to it honestly!

Reunions are great but enough Hollywood BS and let's get back the real GOT moments.

I really hope the rest of the show isn't a bummer.

Not sure how they'll fit in the rest in 5 more episodes.

6/10 and that's being kind"
836,"Whether you hate this or love this there is no middle ground. First two seasons are just ok because it takes time for you to remember large cast names and adapt to show's complexity . But after 3rd season the show is very interesting with some phenomenal action , gruesome and shocking scenes this show is a benchmark in today's television era"
837,"It doesn't matter if you don't like this type of tv-series , it doesn't matter if you are not into history movies or fantasies , because i am pretty sure you are gonna fall in love with this show . It is so well done and scripted that you wouldn't want the series to end.

Unfortunetlly it is rated R and there are many nudity scenes espically in the first 4 seasons of game of thrones and despite the fact that i don't like jaime and cersie' realtionship I would've rated it 10 if it wasn't for that along with some ideas that i wouldn't recommend anyone under 18 to watch .on the otherhand it is still a very good written Series and worth your time . And i would like to rate the seasons as well The first 3 seasons i would rate them 6/10 The rest seasons are 10/10 The 4th season is my favorite and i really loved it . Thanks for reading this ."
838,"Love this series and while I loved the books (okay I loved books 1-3) this series has done a spectacular job realizing Martin's world. You do not have to be a fan of the books to love this series, it's just phenomenally done. I'm a little worried about where HBO has taken Tyrion's character in season 7, but hold out hope that HBO writers will do right by him. I fall into the camp of not liking the sex and nudity so prevalent, especially in the first few years. Reading the books I could skim over those parts and on tv it's really in your face and to me doesn't add much to the plot..but that is my personal opinion and I have a fast forward button that I can use when I want. But I did ding Martin's excellent novels for it and I'll ding HBO's excellent series one small star for it as well...but despite that part, it remains one of the best series I have ever scene book adaption or not."
839,You're probably livin way back if u haven't watched game of thrones
840,Breathtaking is the only word that can explain this
841,This show is just epic. There's really no show like it. Going to be a sad day for television and HBO once this show ends.
842,Such a good show. The character you either really hate or just love. Definitely recommend
843,Absolutely amazing from start to finish. The acting is superb and the writing is phenomenal
844,"This work is untochable , the best cenimatic work ever done ... everything is Just perfct and beyond description . Its really amazing when you relize how much effort is done to produce this mind blowing series . Acting , background music , characters , plot , ...... everything is faaantastic ."
845,"For me Game of thrones is the best show i have ever watched in my entire life. Its so good that there are no shows even close to it.

The music.. oh my god.. the music is just so damn good that i would give it a 10 only for the music. Then there are everything else.. drama, magic, incredible actors, shock moments like in no other show. It has litteraly everything u want in a tv-show.

I really pitty those who havent watched it yet cause they are missing the best thing ever on tv.

Season 1 is a 10/10 Season 2 is a 10/10 Season 3 is a 10/10 Season 4 is a 10/10 Season 5 is a 9/10 Season 6 is a 9/10 Season 7 is a 8/10

Even the lowest rated game of thrones season is for me better then every other show out there, so good is that.

And thank you so much David Benihoff and D.B weiss for giving us this amazing show."
846,"I wanted to write a review a long ago but somehow I couldn't.This is my first review and this show deserves it. This show is great from the start. Great acting, great story, everything is great about this show. Just avoid the negative reviews , you should definitely watch it, just go for it."
847,"This is not only the best TV show ever made, it's for me the best experience on screen TV or movie i've ever had! The cinematography, the acting, the story, this huge universe created, the tension and of course the music made by the amazing Ramin Djawadi!!! It is perfect! I just can't wait for season 8 it's going to be phenomenal!"
848,Simply the best show there ever was or will be. There has never lived a more loyal fan base.
849,And i'm still alive to watch da flippin 8th season .......
850,"Unbelievably realistic and unpredictable. It's everything great about every movie all in one! Horror, fantasy, suspense, action, thriller, romance, comedy and of course slightly pornographic at times. Incest, zombies, giants, dragons, witches and much more! I've watched it 3 times eagerly awaiting season 8!"
851,Simply the greatest show ever!! I hate to see it come to an end. Enough said
852,"I cant explain in words... i have never seen any tv shows or movies like this!! Impossible! This is absolutely the best thing i have ever watched! The work that has put into these episodes of every season! The scripts! The music! The characters! The drama! The horror! The thriller! The adventures! The crimes! Its beyond amazing! The story!! Ughh!

I used to hear people always talk about this ' game of thrones' show.. i never really liked it! It was rlly weird for me! because i know i dont like these kind of tv shows, but one day i thought i would give it a try ..im not gonna lie i gave up on first episodes and decided not to continue .. but i started to see game of thrones everywhere! And i was annoyed! How could people like this show?? But i got rlly bored one day and i wanted to force my self to like this show, after i finished the first season, 2 days later i finished 3 seasons. And i finished all seasons in a a week lol. I was going crazy, i didnt force my self, i didnt like it, i fu-ing loved it! A masterpiece, something u wont see everyday in movies ir tv shows! Enjoyyy"
853,Raised the bar so much for others. waiting for the final season.
854,"I can't say much about how great the show is without spoiling it. It's just amazing. The rich intense backstory is impeccable and the character development is noteworthy. From Violence, gore, sex, to dragons, zombies, other mythical creatures, the show has it all that requires for it to be an extraordinary true-to-book fantasy series. Every episode is densely packed with story. Every move, every twitch, every word, everything a character does is important to the story. All in all, this show is a must-watch."
855,"Thats a fact. Nothing tops this show right here. It has everyhing you want. From acting, to visuals to script to dragons, to Peter Dinklage. What more do you want. Only thing that would make it better would be if Michael Jacksons music was played in the background. Thats it."
856,"Game of Thrones is a phenomenal series that has much to offer. The story is so in depth with a vast background, and characters are highly fleshed out with much to them. Every episode keeps me glued to the screen. I love this show so much, and would highly recommend to everyone to at least give it a try."
857,Game of thrones season 8 waiting...its like good performance good characters nice story well all good
858,"I think that Game of thrones is a show that destroyed a regular process in it's audiences minds. when you think some thing will hapend it wont and exactly something will happend that you never thoght. In adition it will learn people alot of things like to be ""no one"". It goes much higher than people's imagination and wher your mind is too up it will unleash you and you will have a great free fall experiment"
859,"Story, Cast, Acting, VFX etc every is Tremendous also Most Realistically Written Series, Realism means nothing blurred or muted or cut e.g. Sex Scenes & violence Scenes which makes it different from other TV series & Amazing & Realistic... Also High Fantasy, Kings, Queen, Wars, White Walker (Snow Monsters) & Dragons Makes it Great High fantasy TV Series... To the point & Close to the Book, This TV series is Magnificent & Excellent, I Really Liked it Rated 10/10 Regards"
860,"Wow...I cant believe it's been so long since Season 1 aired. I'll never forget randomly stumbling onto the series with no previous knowledge of its existence, just after the Season 1 finale aired. I didn't have much binge watching experience under my belt at that point, but GoT definitley played a huge part in changing the way I watched most TV series the future had in store for me.

I watched all of Season 1 in no more than two days. One of very few shows I can vividly remember where I was, what I was doing, and how I was feeling when the credits rolled. Boy, what a treat that first season was! I knew then, without ever having to see any further episodes, that GoT was a show I would no doubtedly stick with from beginning to end, no matter what.

That first season definitely set the tone for the rest of the series, in every aspect, and you can expect to have many of the same emotions, good and bad (there will be plenty of both), throughout the rest of the series. If you're looking for a show that will never leave you wanting to scratch your eyes out, GoT isn't for you. It's a certified roller coaster of emotions.

If you're a fan of sci-fi or fantasy, GoT is absolutely mandatory. However, the show has so much to offer that it's mandatory for a lot more than sci-fi and fantasy fans. You'd be easier making of a list of the people who wouldn't thoroughly enjoy GoT. It would definitley be significantly shorter.

My ONLY two gripes with the show (hence 8 stars instead of 10) is what I see as a few failures in the story's development pace and scope. This occurred mostly in Season 2. I won't give anything away, but certain storylines from Season 2 dragged so god-awfully slow for me. I feel like it reached out of its own Season 2 realm and affected certain (but small) parts of the seasons that followed. I've zeroed in on what I think went wrong, and after a flawless and extremely well-received season one, the writers got a little too big headed and swung way too hard for the fences in Season 2 and ultimately bit off more than they could chew. What I mean by that is the time constraints involved with any television production mixed poorly with how exhaustively detailed the books are and the writers thought they could get way more accomplished than what TV time allowed for. There were way too many insignificant characters introduced and their story lines ended up being dead ends in the long run, consequently leaving a few openings in the plot that should've been closed or should've never even existed in the first place in the later seasons. To sum up, I would say GoT is as close as it gets to flawless without being so, and Season 2 is what prevented that acheievement.

Nevertheless, don't let it stop you from experiencing one of the greatest shows you'll ever watch on television. I cannot WAIT for the final season!"
861,Awesome show...i can't even stop watching after i finished itself..i start it from beginning
862,This show is beautifully done. I recommend watching every episode twice to ensure you take in the splendor of the scenery and the story. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!
863,Attention been given to each minor possible detail
864,"Only recently have I begun watching. I am into the fifth season. The story is great and the acting too. For me Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) is the hero of the series, he steals the spotlight very easily. The other main characters are very good too. I was also happily surprised when I realized that David Benioff was the creator because I had read his excellent novel City of Thieves and I understand now why GOT is as good as it is :). The original book of George R.R. Martin must be also very good since it is the basis of the series. My original rating was 9 however I dropped it down to 7 because I believe (like many viewers) that it capitalized too much on cheap thrills such as graphic gore and violence and sex. There was no need for all that. It could have been as good and even better if it didn't pander too much to the lowest instincts of the worst human scum."
865,This is the best series in the world I've ever seen.
866,"Although its not my favourite tv show, its definitly the best thing I have ever watched.....and this is coming from somebody who dislikes on screen nudity! The storyline is rediculously brilliant and the characters are very well written because its seems that nobody is perfect and I find that characters i hated in the early seasons, i love now (take Theon for example)."
867,"Game of Thrones is a great show because it is a gateway into fantasy for people who don't like fantasy. The show might not have the dialogue of shows like Breaking Bad or The Sopranos, but it's level of entertainment is just as high. With many great characters, shocking twists and extreme violence (and sex) GOT is binge-worthy tv show. The only reason I am not giving this a 10/10 is because of season 7. I will not go into details but it's definitely not up to par with the other seasons. Also, if you like battle scenes, I STRONGLY recommend the show to you."
868,All I can say about game of thrones is that it is and for me is the best television show in the past 10 years.
869,"As you can tell from my rating, I like it alot more than I dislike it. It's a show about a complex, interesting conflict set in a huge, open, authentic world.

The world being authentic is probably due to the incredible production design. Entire cities are portrayed with the help of background-actors, set pieces, buildings etc. that have been constructed and placed with care. There are other factors contributing to the world being authentic such as religion, politics, segregation, wealth and poverty. Factors that are not over exposed (since that would be boring to watch) but rather discretely shown and mentioned throughout the show, giving you the sense of an authentic world.

But authentic world-building is worth nothing if the story taking place in that world isn't good. The story itself, is actually good. It's a very nuanced, complex story, especially when you consider that the fantasy genre is known for the 'good vs evil' black and white, linear type of story.

My problems start with the way that the story is being presented to the viewer. This show has a tendency to be over-ambitious, to assume that the viewer knows things that haven't been explained yet (this is probably because the show is based on a series of books). Already from the first episode we are getting locations, names, characters, and the relations between those characters thrown at us and expected to understand it, and even enjoy it. The majority of the story of the entire first season is told through dry, emotionless dialogue. The creators embrace 'show don't tell' as the show goes on, but it really took a lot of motivation to keep watching through the first season. I really, really started to enjoy the show in later seasons when I actually understood whom the characters where, and how they all related to each other, now I could properly react to every event happening, although this should have happened a lot sooner.

My final complaint is about some of the cinematography (especially during fight-scenes) is poorly executed and makes it hard to understand what exactly is going on. Let's say two characters are dueling with swords: the angle changes way too often, and the frame is way to cramped to make out anything that's happening, more than that two people are fighting."
870,I think this series the best series in the world and I love it so much for me season 6 the best season and episode 9 the best episode
871,Game of thrones is truly incredible and outstanding tv series .Its adaptation and acting is realistic.
872,Perfection is what defines this show. Best Story Best Characters Best Fantasy World Extremely Unpredictable Best Theme Best Directing Best Music
873,"A gripping tale of human relations set in a fictional medieval world, it might seem off-putting at first to commit yourself to what would seem like a typical tale of knights and evil kings, but it is the exact opposite of that. ""Game of Thrones"", adapted to the screen from George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" book series, is a masterful television production, which utilizes the complex plot and characters to their fullest potential. You never really know who's gonna make it after you settle in during the first few episodes and understand what's even happening. Once you have an idea what the plot is about, you can't really stop thinking about it. So many characters, each with their own motivations and mysterious plots- you just can't help but be pulled into it all, not fully knowing who you like most and who you can't stand. The characters are among the best in the history of literature, and are all dynamic and come alive on the screen. The conventional filmmaking is also top quality, as is expected from a top tier production. There are no foul editing mistakes, bad acting sequences or truly questionable motivations- it is all quite perfectly done. The main point that this show proves (not concerning the plot), is that the setting, in this case a medieval fantasy world, should not determine what the viewer should expect from it. As much as I would personally enjoy a well done, typical fantasy show with fantasy tropes, this is not it. No such tropes are used and the world is a dirty, realistic look at the nature of human relations, entwined with the supernatural."
874,I can easily say this will always remain the best TV show ever ever made.
875,"I think Game Of Thrones is the best movie i ever seen , more action and fantasy .. 2 think that i love to see in a movie ! Actors play their role with passion and in my opinion very well! The locations in the movie are great .. I really love this series and would like to have more than 8 seasons :("
876,"I'm writing this review after watching the finale of season 7 and unaware of what's to come, what's ahead of us in season 8. The show has at this point overcome the books and season 8 will wrap it all up. And so far so good. To me GOT will go down as one of the best shows in the history of TV, regardless of what may happen in the last season. Before GOT came along I wouldn't dare to think that a fantasy-based show may have a place on TV. And I don't think I was the only one. The scale on which GOT works is massive both in terms of financial resources and sheer scope of its storytelling. The story is based on George R.R. Martin's saga A song of ice a fire, witch helps get the show off the ground during the first 5 seasons. Even if I'd rather choose the books over the TV show both are just great. Complex political plots and subplots, treason, betrayal, politics, war, vengeance, new powers and old powerall of that is depicted masterfully y the Game of Thrones world. It's by far my favorite fantasy saga, probably alongside The Lord of the Rings. Yet we don't know how neither the books nor the show will be regarded in the future, I believe it's a safe bet to safe that they'll be close Tokien's The Lord of the Rings or nearby."
877,"OK I'm gonna just say that this is probably the best show that's ever aired like no doubt. I was never really a fan of Lord of the Rings and fantasy so I didn't think this show was gonna be as good as everyone said it was. I couldn't have been more wrong. It is epic! You start off with you know pretty good stuff there's a twist at the start which gets you into it and then it builds up and then at the end of the first season you're like wtf just happened?! How can they do that lol this is GOOD. Yeah so you're like damn this is a good show still not as good as like Sopranos or Breaking Bad or whatever. Then you get through season 2 and you're still thinking this is a damn good show then once again at the end you're like this is sick! Then you get to 3&4 and you know that this is the best show out there. I can't explain and I don't wanna tick the spoiler box so I'm gonna just say some serious 'stuff' goes down. Twists like once an episode, battles which are epic, some emotional stuff as well. Game of Thrones does annoy you with the stuff they do sometimes but there is this one bit which is a massive 'hell yeah' moment which seems like a treat for the fans. Then season 5 is a little bit under the usual standard I must say, still amazing though, but the last few episodes of it are still sick, probably some of the best there. Season 6 is my personal favourite though. It is amazing! So much stuff that you can't even imagine it's just too good. I'm not even gonna say anything it's just INCREDIBLE. This show is the most well acted, directed, written, produced show out there. The budget is phenomenal and you can tell in the episodes. The work they must put into every aspect of the show is incredible. The massively well planned twists, the incredible battle scenes, the humour, the connection with the characters; it all is just so so good. I cannot wait for season 7 and I bet its gonna somehow be better than the show is already. Best show out there I'm telling you. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it. (I couldn't swear in this and I really ******* wanted to)"
878,"No TV series or movies can be compared to GoT.

The story in GoT is absolutely amazing, filled with interesting and ""realistic"" plot twists and unexpected events.

Acting is great, costumes and scenery as well. Every character is unique and interesting, and its great watching them develop. Everything is top quality.

If you start watching this, be prepared to get addicted quickly - you'll just feel a strong urge to watch the next episode, and another, and another until no more episodes are left.

There is a downside to GoT however that needs to be mentioned: as many have stated, after watching it, you will realize that 99% shows/movies out there are not up to its standards. A show of this quality is rare indeed."
879,"Simply amazing. No other TV series can ever compete game of thrones when it comes to story line, surprises and battles. The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting. Game of Thrones on HBO is a TV adaption of George R.R. Martin's books, a Song of Ice and Fire.It is difficult to translate books into movies or TV series, but HBO's GoT made it look easy.I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering."
880,"In my honest opinion, Seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 were a masterpiece of cinematography, acting and storytelling, but something has now gone drastically wrong.

Season 5 was downright boring and Season 6 has not fared much better, taking about 8 episodes to get into is stride and bouncing around locations almost aimlessly like a broken pinball machine.

I am beginning to wonder if the author has lost interest in this huge undertaking or if there been a change of scriptwriter?

Based upon the first 4 seasons I would have easily scored 9\10, but the huge disappointments of the latter seasons makes me ""with regret"" reduce this to 6/10"
881,"The books are fantastic. The cast is brilliant, minus Geoffrey (he looks like a weasel), the scenery and script is also top notch.

Episodes could be even longer, it might grip people longer to the story. More sex scenes too, like Spartacus. Also more blood and fighting. More nudity would also add more spark to the show.

Stark Senior is a great actor for his part, there should be more opportunities to make him appear like a main character, particularly special in my opinion.

Making the show more scenic and putting emphasis on improving the quality of music would also make the show nicer,

Loving the show. Keep it up!"
882,"Why must all the so-called fantasies happen in somewhere that resembles ancient or medieval Europe? If that's claimed to be a fantasy WORLD, the place in which it happens must be fantasy too. What's with all of those fake languages? Why do they have to create some new languages when it comes to a fantasy world? Is a fantasy world just a place with normal people who speak uncanny or not-yet-heard languages? Is a constructed language even necessary when you have to put some subtitles there so that the audience knows what they are talking about?! Reviving John snow was lame and the Ed Sheeran part was also a big disappointment."
883,"I will get straight to the point. Great story but lacking action. The scenes, costumes and music is great. This has lots of talk and talk, but very little action which is quite disappointing. Just like it says Adventure/Drama/Fantasy is the genre which they are right about. They know how to hype you for the next episode with there tactics, and once you you will see the following episode you will be quite disappointed as you will only see them talking and again no action. I have found this quite boring. If there would be more action, great fights as we all would love to see, especially the dragon ones then this would get 10/10. If you don't like violence and like to see people talk then this is definitely for you and you will love this."
884,"I just as well might tag each of the lovers of this show, with a few exceptions, as White males. ""Hi, I'm a White male, and GoT is the best thing ever since ever.""

I give the story 10 of 10, the acting 10 of 10. What ruins this show is the editing. How many times must I pause and explain to other watchers what is happening? Additionally, how long do you have to make them wait to buy in to caring about one character or another? But not to worry, if you are about the tune out, boobs. Watch because boobs. I get the context and need for the nudity and sex and rape...but it must support the story. If it doesn't it is just porn. And there is nothing wrong with porn, but I am not necessarily sitting down to watch GoT to get off. I am watching for a good story. Too much of this sexual content essentially spoils the story for me. But, I am not a White male. If I was, I might welcome the sexual interludes even though they do not enhance the story. It would be the same to me as including random fight scenes with no explanation, dialogue with no meaning, or characters constantly introduced and then never seen again. Where's the substance? Oh, right, its hidden behind that boob.

Sorry--just misses the mark. Too bad. I'd rather read it now."
885,"I am not one of its fans. For its childish stories, for the feeling after a season biging. But its virtues are many. And real. From performances of great actors to magnificent use of CGI. For the portraits and for something who you feel authentic and slice of near reality. For the tension and for high care to details. For music and for the mark of HBO. For the sides of cruelty and references to mythologies and Medieval history. For a sort of genius to reflect contemporary realities. And, especially, for the touching portraits of kindness, duty spirit and sacrifice. For me, it is not a film of a story but the film of its characters. And lovely actors. A parable - serie.

Yes, I am not its fan. But I admitt - a am dependent by it. First, for the inspiration to use old great actors , from Diana Rigg to Max von Sydow. And, sure, for the great performances of young actors, from Emilia Clarke to Maisie Williams. The great virtue of serie - to remind the taste of classic fairy tales. And the charme, so seductive charme of them."
886,Easy recommend to anyone who wants to watch something he will never forget nor regret
887,"I love the show. I love the show when it has bad episodes. I love the show when it has boring characters. I love the show when the story makes no sense. But, that being said... Emilia Clarke may be the worst actress ever."
888,"3 words which describe the show..""what just happened!?"""
889,Damn you gotta watch it its an amazing tv show don't let any body tell you otherwise it's non-dibatable!!! So go ahead and watch it you'll thank me later
890,Game of throne is best tv series in warfare category
891,It's the greatest show The story The casting The directing The actors performance All perfect
892,Game of thrones is the best serie I have ever watch in my life. I think game of thrones deserves 10/10. Every one must watch game of thrones.

Great Costume Design by Michele Clapton(Sense & Sensibility ) & April Ferry(Elysium) ,great Score By Ramin Djawadi(Iron Manl),Showrunner(s) D.B. Weiss (Always Sunny In Philadelphia) & David Beinoff(Troy) An Authentic High Fantasy TV Series 8/10"
894,"Having watched all seven seasons now I would still rate this as a 10.

For anyone that says its not my kind of thing watch episode 1 of season 1. For those I have convinced to do this, they have become instantly hooked.

It is monumental in production with such stunning locations. The cast are superb, with the casting of Sean Bean it instantly grabbed everyone. With the beauty of Emilia Clarke we are all in love with Daenarys. Yet others inspire us with great passion of like or loathe. Characters you love and hate have equal chances of dying. You cannot predict it and if you still haven't tried it then give it a chance.

If you are in any doubt look at the average rating of 9.5 from over a million people, then look up your favourite TV programmes of all time and you will find this rates as one of the best out there.

Have a go and watch the first episode..."
895,"This show is not only the best show I've ever seen, it is always like watching a cinematic movie. From moment to moment, sides change and people you love may die. It never leaves you disappointed and there are no bad episodes...just some that may change your complete attitude for another character; always changing loyalties and building new alliances. And that is where the show always surprises and shocks. You never know, but you'll never forget. The actors/actresses are so skilled in making this show a gem. They can go from good to bad to worst. The rotten ones will blow your mind with their talents. You will most probably watch each episode several times to sync your mind with the names of all the characters...I never get bored watching the older episodes. You will find things you missed, and covert operations between kingdoms that will shock and thrill you. I'm not giving anything away, as you will want to discover each episode and character for yourself. Plenty of loved ones and people who you wish to die...sometimes shortly before they do. This story could go on forever, and you will want it to. Don't miss this...you will want to get involved immediately!

Valar Marghulis. Valar Dohaeris."
896,"Best TV series ! highly recommend it to everyone, all seasons and episodes are amazing,everything is so professional, waiting for season 6 now, I wish game of thrones never ends, now I read book, and book is great too. Jon Snow is my favorite character. Acttress is very beautiful, all things is so important there. I like every thing, time, people, actress, that every thing is not expectable.

897,"WHOLE: This show is mind-blowing. There is no other way to put it. And the reason for that is because in most shows and most movies, you feel confident that your favorite character, or the protagonist, is going to be safe (or at least until the very end of the show/movie). This show is like real world. No one is safe. Anything can happen to anyone. The second reason it is mind-blowing is because this show (or the books it is derivative of) has created a whole new world, and I mean that literally. With new history, new religions, new species, new geography, new medicines, this is a different earth. Couple that with a plethora of characters with such intricate personalities and motives, this show is a masterpiece.

SEASON 1: The first season of the show is extremely faithful to the book. It follows it almost exactly. It is a fairly slow season, with a lot of world building. It, however, is very interesting as you get a good look at every character you are dealing with, and shows the growing tension between every character. I thought this was a fairly decent season, however, started of a bit boring. I guarantee if you stick with it, it will be worth your time.

SEASON 2: This is where the show starts splitting away from the books a bit. This season started picking up from season 1 and actually started showing the war in action. More characters are introduced, more world building, more tension, more action. It gave some characters more spotlight and really showed us what drives them.

SEASON 3: This is where the show gets really interesting. There are so many factors at play everywhere, and all the characters start falling apart. This is where we start seeing a change in every character. It is one of the best seasons in the entire show.

SEASON 4: Hands down, best season. The other 3 seasons have been building up a lot of tension and this where every thing goes down. Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat, and now we see all hell break loose.

SEASON 5: This is where the show truly turns away from the books. The show has started going down its own path, and many things that never happened in the books are happening. The first half of this season was fairly crap, with barely anything happening, and very sloppy dialogue, but as always it payed off in the second half with some of the best episodes in the entire show.

CONCLUSION: Overall, definitely worth watching. Though it may be slow at times, it always pays off. Many book-readers are upset at how different this show has become to the books, but I am actually happy about that, as the show could never be as intricate as the books and hence following it exactly would not pay off. By following their own story the writers can make the show appropriate to its medium. Lastly, THIS SHOW REQUIRES SERIOUS COMMITMENT. If you are not paying attention, and are not aware of all the numerous things going on, you wont truly understand how great the show is. I recommend watching the History&Lore series to help you understand this world better and learn more context."
898,"It's an amazing show.My Friends keep telling me that it is a must watch.I watched it recently.I feel really bad for not watching it earlier.My friends also told me that it might seem not so good initially during 4 or 5 episodes.So,I started watching it at a weekend and Oh my God,I can't stop myself after I get into it.I ate only 2 times in a day.I completed full 5 Seasons in 3 days..watching it even midnight.It literally blows away my mind. Peter Dinklage(Imp) is my Favorite character.But all Characters are detailed.The seems like it Really exist.Theme music is great. when Jon snow died,I was like WTF.But I think he had a contract for few more Seasons so it's no wonder if he comes back...maybe with the help of red lady. White walkers seems something out of this world..but they seems quite amazing in the Show.When night's king,on his horse over the mountain, looked Jon snow,it gave me a chill in my spine..that's the best moment for me. HBO has done a great work.It's better than movies. Can't wait for Season 6...A must watch show."
899,"Game of thrones has a great and addicting storyline. Multiple characters with their own storyline that goes in depth. Even the misses who isn't a fan of fantasy like story's at all is in love with the show. Started reading the books because of the show. The best thing the story does is making you think that certaing things won't happen or that the story is impossible to evolve into something else from certain points. And yet you keep getting surprised and the storyline keeps evolving and getting better and better. Besides the gread in depth story lines of the characters, the actors really know to play out the character. Afther you watched the first season it won't take long before you have watched everything. Please do yourself a favor and start watching game of thrones."
900,"I will start with saying that all these initial reviews on IMDb by the users are laughable - people had watched just one or few episodes and were dull enough to think they have tasted the full cake. Onwards with the show - first episodes feel indeed leaving you very much puzzled about who is who, what is going on, who are the persons mentioned in ascribed events and how precisely were they involved. For the people like me who haven't read the novel there is so much of story to soak up that it's easily to get lost and to be left with a need to rewatch the episode to fully grasp the big picture. But as the series continue and plotting of characters (that you are already familiar with from the first episode) progress you will start to clue the puzzling threads together. And as events also progress the main characters become more and more interesting, fascinating, sympathetic or abominable. I'd just recently started watching the series and I don't regret making through first few episodes. Each episode adds more and more to the table leaving you wondering and wanting to see next one."
901,"Game of thrones is one of the best TV shows ever made.It is in the leauge of Breaking Bad which is also incredible. What makes it such a good show is the vastness of it. Its a huge setting, huge cast and huge plot with so many twists and turns. The acting is amazing and you start to relate to certain characters on a personal level. The graphic violence and explicit sex just add to the perfection of the show.

Short review but please start to watch Game of Thrones because you will not be disappointed. Forget big brother and CSI, this is the real thing! 10/10. Also you may wish to read the books before hand but its not imperitive. The books are quite breath taking though."
902,"Though I recommend a strong and mature mind to follow the story line, the series is fantastic. From blood to deceit to sex, to whispered secrets and false allies, to secretive passageways and clever plot lines; the series is a grand masterpiece. The characters themselves make the stories just marvellous. There's so many, yet none are the same. Some are good, some are strong, some are honest, some are clever, and some are stupid. Their actions can make you cringe or scream out in delight, or you find yourself cheering on some and hating others, just like any other good TV series. The actions that are taken, and how events evolve into something more, is just so cleverly done, by both the author and the creator of the TV series. (Would that be the author too?)

And though the story takes place in a medieval time period, with fantasy creatures and knights with swords, the language is not all that difficult to understand.

The only con to this series is that there are SO MANY CHARACTERS. Though I know each and every one, maybe read the books before so you have an idea of who every one is. I know some people sometimes mix other characters up, and the story moves quickly, so you MUST PAY ATTENTION TO EVERY EPISODE.

Either way, to any one who loves blood sex and drama, this series is right up in your alley.

For me, I can't imagine this story/series getting any better. And the actors are fantastic, they make the story so much more real. They really stick true to the book."
903,"Never seen such a plot. Everything is here. All the things forbidden by religions of the world, which were actually present in the past. If you are taking it seriously, then you would get to know what the writer wants to convey. THE REALITY of humans! The show is about two clans, 1 in North and other in south. First season deals largely with North clan and there battles with themselves. Main character is a Lord, Eddard Stark, whose family lives in a cold region called Winterfell. There is boundary in the city called as Wall, outside which White Walkers live, supernatural characters. King Robert comes to meet stark and ask for his help and ask him to go with him to his land and set matters right. Ultimately the kings wife gets all the bad work done and be the reason to start a war with the Starks. If you want a show with no bullshit, grim reality of our kings and lots of honor filled characters, just watch it."
904,"Game of Thrones is an otherworldly drama set in about the middle ages. This world has a civilized feudal Southern territory and a frozen wasteland to the North. North and south are separated by a enormous insurmountable wall of ice built and guarded by the territories south of the wall. The north is inhabited by wild-lings and ""white walkers"" The South is made up of seven kingdoms with one supreme ruler who sits on the iron throne. Power is inherited via bloodlines. Game of thrones is the drama intrigue and conquest and general skulduggery that surrounds who will sit on the iron throne.While other things brew north of the wall...

I must admit that my first impressions of the the first 3 episodes was that it was little more than a tiresome medieval soap opera. I am a chronic insomniac so one night had run out of things to watch, By the end of Season 1 I was an addicted."
905,The Show is OK . drags on and on . lots of homosexual propaganda. 10 episodes a season tell you that their isn't enough to write a full 20 episode season even with the amount of money going into it. if you like to watch a slow story about nothing this is the show for you. hardly any fighting or war scenes. im really surprised its still running. aren't show supposed to get better over the years they are out . oh wait 30 episodes lol what a joke. like i said earlier for the amount of money put into the show they could easily had more episodes. if they cant do it with the same quality then they really do suck. not much more to this show.
906,"Game of thrones is easily the most popular show in the world right now and I have finally finished the seventh season of the show and this show is still top quality. The premise of the season sees the different entities of westeros trying to survive the winter. There are tons of characters on this show but in my opinion in this season the two man characters are jon snow played by kit Harrington and daenerys targaryian played by Emilia clarke. They are both great characters and you see the both of them develop this season and the show does a really good job showing them in unique lights that makes them more interesting. All the supporting cast is great, tryion, cersei and Jaime lannister all have great moments this season that further enhance them as some of the best characters on any TV show. Sansa and arya stark are given bigger roles this season and it works really well as there story develops in a very unique way that I wasn't expecting. I could go through every supporting character but I would be here all day so just know that the performances are top quality. The story this season is shorter then previous seasons but I really feel they did a good job of balancing the different story lines. I really enjoyed the development of the white walker storyline and I feel like that is really the end game for the show. I also feel the relationship story lines were handled a lot better this season. The script is great, the drama really works this season as more characters get reunited the tension does rise. But also for certain characters the humour was also really handled well. The style of the show has never been grander as the effects are incredible, the battle scenes are massive this season with the scale really delivering. Because of the lower episode count this season is faster paced but you fall right in and it feels right. Overall I really loved this season and can't wait for the next and last season."
907,"It's an excellent programme spoilt by spin and media attention. The recent episode with the graphic shot of the penis and scrotum reinforced the inequality of nudity in the production where all females hide behind merkins so there is no full female nudity. I would prefer no genital nudity as a production of this quality does not need it. The parents guide is currently incorrect and really needs to be corrected to:-

Partial female nudity only , all genitalia being either covered or CGI altered. Full male nudity including close up graphic views of genitalia

The current guide implies a lot of female nudity but only as much as you would see on a beach"
908,"First I must say that I have never seen a television show on the scale of game of thrones. The sets effects and costumes are amazing and really bring the world described in the books to life. Everyone, especially the child actors, are extremely well cast and all give convincing performances. The story is compelling and does make you want to see more however, for me, there are a few things that let this series down. Do not get me wrong, I love many American series and films, however, no one, not even the Americans themselves, can say they are known for being subtle (or particularly realistic). The sex in this series is gratuitousness and feels like its just been thrown in because they think the audience will get bored if there isn't something going on every second. This really detracts from the realism of not only the events but also the relationships between the characters. I know that a certain amount of sex and violence comes with the genre and I didn't think the violence was too bad however, I find it hard to sympathize with characters where the majority of their personality centres around sexuality (e.g.constantly using prostitutes or raping women every five seconds). To be fair, however, the non-sexual relationships, such as between ayra and her father feel genuine and real. In short, I think game of thrones is a very good series and one I will definitely watch the second series of however, I feel the sensationalism detracts from the reality of the characters and their relationships."
909,"I really can't tell what people like about this series. It's labeled as ""fantasy"" but mostly it could be labeled as ""war "" or ""horror"". The series as a whole is utterly depressing - everyone dies or gets raped or mutilated and it drags on and on from one morose black point to the next.

If you like ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Shannara Chronicles"", then please do not bother with this one. If you like "" the human centipede"" or ""a serbian movie"", then this gorefest will probably be of your taste."
910,"The PR for the series has been that it is good enough to be considered a ""Lord Of The Rings"" quality/genre project for TV. Not quite. It plays an awful lot like an old 1950's Universal Studios medieval potboiler. The sort of thing you would expect to see Tony Curtis or Alan Ladd in. It certainly isn't up to the normal HBO standard when compared with a production like ""Rome"". Maybe, as the series progresses, a stronger storyline might start to appear. The production values are handsome enough for TV, but overall the atmosphere is very dull. By and large, the cast seems to be not overly interested in the material. They could be waiting to see some improvement before they bother trying."
911,"It has an excellent script and we are always surprised by the versatility of the actors, is a series with a script suitable to represent the extent of the book on which it is based. Very entertaining, worthy of a marathon. One of the improvements of adventure drama and medieval type fiction"
912,"Great series, but the delay to launch new chapters erases the brilliance of the plot. The public waits more than a year to continue following the story and this delay makes it forgotten even the last chapter seen. There are people who by this have already given up on keeping up. Those responsible should have more respect with the public and repair this failure!"
913,"This is with out a doubt the best show on television. Nothing comes close to this. Everything about this show is fantastic. Great acting from the cast. Peter Dinklage is mind blowing good as Tyrion Lannister. The music by Ramin Djawadi is also great, so is the directing. But the best part of the show is not the acting, directing, effect or the music.

The best part is the writing. The fantastic dialog between character, the amazing shocking twist and turns, the character development. The story is what really sells it as the greatest show probably ever seen. I can't wait for season 7 and 8. Also can't wait for book 6 and 7."
914,"I had heard nothing but praise about this show from friends, and I have nothing against fantasy, so I gave it a shot.

If you have read the books, this show might be the best thing since sliced bread, but for a casual viewer it's a let down. As I understand it, the plans are to do one book per season. But judging from season 1, there simply isn't enough material in one book for almost 10 hours of television. Let's compare it to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, where the total running time for all three movies - in the extended editions, mind you - is roughly 12 hours. I think ""Game of Thrones"" would benefit greatly from merging two books into, say, a 12 episode season. 6 hours per book is still abundant to tell the story.

One common problem with make believe kingdoms and countries (not only with the fantasy genre) is the geography. I remember the first time I read ""Lord of the Rings"" in an edition which had no map, and it made no goddamned sense where all the places were in relation to one another, which led to a frustrating read. But ""Game of Thrones"" solves this problem beautifully in the opening credits.

The opening scene set in a wintery landscape on the other side of the wall, or whatever it's called, is very good and it sets up a nice feel of mystery. But sadly, it's all downhill from there. The multitude of characters are for the most part one-dimensional and unengaging. The plot sprawls thin and lacks direction, making me lose interest quite quickly."
915,"A TV-Serie witch i decided to look at after i've seen the czech masterpiece Neviditelni, with the goal to criticize it .So i have very low expectations.Even so the series are much bad then my expectations.The actors play owful and the story is insanely boring."
916,"Once you watch it, you can't stop. This show is the greatest show of them all. Amazing plot and characters. You can't predict what's about to happen. The series is full of twist and turns. The CGI and scope of it is something unheard of in television. It's a 73 hour movie, that's what it is.

Great acting from everyone from the cast. But the best part of the show is not the action, battles or the violence. The best part is the amazing dialogues between characters and the all the well layered characters that live in this rich world of Essos and Westeros."
917,"Slow, long and boring. I tried twice to watch it but always failed to achieve first episode. Same thing happened with lord of the rings. But I found World of Warcraft great. So this is bad heroic fantasy."
918,Best TV series you'll ever watch ! You will learn to love all characters protagonists and antagonists because all characters are amazingly acted and perfected . You wouldn't find any other actor fit to act any character the same way . The story is more than spectacular . Thanks for this masterpiece :)
919,"Is one of the best TV shows in history and will be for more years to come. The two masterminds between this show are one of the best creators and made a marvelous job. Nevertheless, George R.R. Martin is a sick man with all the intrigues and plots he wrote in those books. I never read the books, but the show is very good.

For the newcomers, I'll recommend it."
920,"After writing 3 reviews about shows on CW I was desperate to find something nice to say about someone. And then I remembered Game of Thrones. I am redeemed!!!

Good writing and actors equal to the scripts. Everyone's performance is realistic, and even the children have an adult manner about them. A joy to watch, unless, of course, you don't watch it.

The plot is easy enough: first one to beat the other armies to a bloody pulp, wins the Brass Ring. Seven squabbling tribes, each one with big....aspirations. Emilia Clarke is a joy to watch, but everyone is great. Even Maureen Dowd of the New York Times, who claimed she was not a 'sword and sorcery Girl,' found herself, after watching several episodes while she was bedridden during a bout with the flu, yelling on the phone to her friends, when they called to ask if she needed anything, ""BRING ME MY DRAGONS!""

I second that emotion."
921,"Game of Thrones has been a favorite show of mine since it came out with season one. I happen to catch a few episodes with my sister whom had HBO at the time and I was hooked ever since. The first season I remember how difficult it seemed to keep straight names, places, etc since everything was so new but the depth and detail that is described just kept me that much more interested. The twists and turns the show takes with every season there being a gut-wrenching ""oh my god"" moment. Season four was a little slow but otherwise I've been very impressed. I look forward to this season coming out in a few short months!"
922,"Lots of points for production design: the costumes are uniformly magnificent, from the lowest peasant to the highest king. The sets get a tad monotonous after a while: big, colonnaded halls of dark beige and grey and lots of oversized statuary, but even those can be breathtaking in their own way. The CG work just gets better and better with each season: tighter, cleaner, more layered and intricate. Many of the performances are quite good, even after six years, and the photography is outstanding.

That's the good stuff.

The bad? OK, I""m halfway through season 6, binge-watching the DVDs, and the sins of the series are becoming so obvious that the writers are in real need of a walk of atonement. Having not read the books, I don't know how closely they're adhering to them at this point — or if indeed they even are anymore, since I understand much of this season was planned in expectation of the next book which Martin has yet to finish. But increasingly, each episode is a combination of (1) some characters wandering around the countryside in the snow, (2) some characters getting killed off for no particular reason, and (3) one really big CG-laden scene somewhere towards the end to keep you coming back to see what happens next.

My biggest complaint with GOT S1 was that it felt like the old TV show ""Dynasty"" with a lot of fur costumes: lots of rich, powerful people going after each other in a somewhat pointless way. S2-4 gave it a bit of a rise above that, but S5 and (thus far) S6 have almost completely reverted to type: Fantasy Soap Opera with Furs. At this point, I'm not sure why the show has lasted this long: the story lines seem to be running on auto-pilot. There hasn't been much with the same visceral impact as the Red Wedding. By now I would have hoped to see at least something of where the series hopes to wind up, but instead it's just wandering in the snow.

I understand that it's been contracted for two more seasons. I'm starting to wonder if any of the major characters will even be left by then, that perhaps they're bringing it to a close because no one will be left alive to sit on the stupid Iron Throne. That would be almost as disappointing as the ending of LOST, but at this point, certainly not outside the realm of possibility."
923,"This has to easily be the best show that I have ever watched , the setting is perfect . Acting is just simply outstanding and the development of characters and settings as you progress through the series is what truly grips you , Even the cgi is spectacular, much more defined and well balanced than other shows.. As you start off watching the show it takes time for the ambiance and setting of the series to sink in so that you can get easily accumulated every time you start watching again , a whole other world you sink into ; as you progress through the show you start to root for different characters and houses. The best thing is that there is no actual villain in the series but instead different houses that take people on different journeys. The only flaw I see for miles is the fact that there are only 10 episodes per season because once you start , you won't be able to stop yourself from wanting more and more...."
924,"The show is just amazing and worth spending time in front of screen! Well, I was more interested in reading the books but after reading only first book and then watching first season, opted not to read other books before watching.. Yes, it is the biggest achievement of the show that how justified it is to the book series.. The originality, detailing and commendable acting, all contributes to making the show an incredible one. Having just watched first season, I'm spell bound by it and really looking forward to next seasons. Indeed, I postponed reading the book series to not spoil the suspense because I definitely know how things are going to be interesting."
925,"I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.

'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every ""country"", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books – but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.

Yet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes Martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. At the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie and John (and all the – many – others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for Joffrey).

There have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is – at the moment – in a league of its own. A joy to watch: breath-taking, epic – and highly addictive – Television. 10 stars out of 10."
926,"I love the cinematography and the actors in it. The story is Amazing & the way they did their plot is very complex and interesting!!!!!! Love it! I can't wait to watch the other episodes since i haven't seen the rest! But, i know it's good! I am thrilled that your typical Knights & shining armor story is so vividly entertaining & gives a different element to the viewer. 100 thumbs up if i can! I can't wait to watch the next episodes. Your show is the Hit and i will watch this over and over again. Everything is well done and made! Why i think this show is hands-down? I will tell you why. It gives off the suspense in the right time and right moment. I will say, they did a very, pretty good job!"
927,"Some may think that the fame of the Game Of Thrones series is just a matter of trend, but it most definitely is not.

Adapted from George R R Martin's book series ""A song of Ice and Fire"", I believe the popularity of the Game of Thrones series comes from a brilliant adaptation. The characters are all played by great actors, and unlike so many other series today, the characters are not ""one-dimensional"" - they all have their own battles and their own problems, not to mention their own personalities.

Steady character growth is also something too rarely seen and which has been successfully executed here, very notable on characters such as Khalessi played by Emilia Clarke or Jon Snow played by Kit Harrington.

David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were not miserable when it came to placing plot twists and character deaths in episodes, unlike other TV shows such as The Walking Dead where it seems that only the first and last episode of a season needs to be exciting while the rest are as average as they can be.

Every episode of Game of Thrones reveals new and exciting information which makes every episode worth while."
928,"I watched the first two seasons On Demand, then I decided to read all 5 books. I loved the books, but after season 4 I'm convinced that the show is better. The casting of each character is perfect, particularly for Oberyn Martell and Brienne. Peter Dinklage is terrific and Emilia Clarke is sex on wheels. There is a lot of turnover in the casting and I miss some of my favorite characters, but that's just the story.

Seasons 1 and 2 were superb, season 3 dragged a tiny bit and season 4 was the best of the series so far. Largely because of Oberyn Martell.

The show deviates from the book plot a little bit, and just about all of them actually improved the story - filled some holes with a sensible change.

Grand slam home run, HBO. There are a ton of great HBO shows and this is the crown jewel. HBO series beat the crap out of 99% of the movies you're going to find in the theaters now."
929,"Arya Stark the BEST! I couldn't believe she just walked away.......but he did love her, and I think that was the last bite of humanity she had left.....and she wasn't gonna give it to him. Cersei Lannister finally standing up for herself! and showing some power and empathy. Tyrion Lannister..........WOW, you think he killed her because she was sleeping with his father? I felt bad for her, she had to survive. That father needed to die but I was happy he heard the truth before hand. Daenerys don't chain your babies up........feed them! Jon Snow finally stepping it up! Jaime Lannister got his dream to come true..........sick O! Bran Stark, you will not walk, but you will fly! What happen to LittleFinger and Sansa Stark? Just a great ending to the season leaving us wanting more.........but True Blood is about to happen, and American Horror Story should be coming soon!!! I've given up on Bravos Real House Wives.........too much high school flash backs for me........and those women are not so pretty, or interesting."
930,"I had heard about George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire book series for years but never got around to reading it. When they announced the HBO show I was excited because I had a lot of friends who read the books.

But when I actually started watching the show, I actually found it frustrating to watch. There were too many characters with too much backstory that seemed to go unexplained. I felt like the show was moving at a breakneck pace and wasn't catering to the non-book readers at all. By the end of the fourth episode, I gave up. It was too confusing. I couldn't keep track of it all and I felt like the show was moving too fast.

Sometime later, a friend urged me to give it another chance. He lent me the blu-ray of season one and told me to watch the special features that went into the background of the show. After watching that, it clicked with me. I re-watched the first four episodes and loved them a lot more. After that I was hooked. I quickly got caught up with the series and found myself eagerly awaiting season 3.

I started reading the books around that time and only just recently finished book 5. I have to say that the books are even better than the show! While the show is great for its fast paced plot, great acting and stunning visuals, the books take a little more time to flesh out the characters, go into the backstory, and spend a little more time with exposition.

The main problem I have with the show is that it's too fast paced. You have to really pay close attention because if you miss one line of dialog, it's easy to get lost. This was why I gave up when I initially watched it. The show would benefit from the use of flashbacks and a longer season (13 episodes seems perfect). Or maybe just take a bit more time for character dialog to allow for more exposition. I know some people might complain that there's ""too much talking"" already, but I'm not one of those people who needs action all the time in my shows and movies.

That being said, once you understand what's going on, the show is excellent and highly addictive. It's the best ongoing show on television right now. Definitely watch it, and if you get lost, take a break, watch some of the History of Westeros featurettes from the blu-ray (also on youtube) and try again. It's definitely worth it."
931,"After two people I respect suggesting that I might like Game of Thrones, I decided to watch the pilot, since I have HBO on demand and was all caught up on my favorite series. I offer this feedback for the filmmakers of this series and others, and for future potential fans:

I found it difficult to follow, but it was worthy of my patience, and I was genuinely intrigued by certain characters. I know some CGI artists who are crazy for the opening and understand their feelings--I find the opening does a disservice in that it fails to set the tone, it is confusing and has too many little details distracting from what you really need to know. If you want to compare openings that really capture the essence and set the tone - compare this one to Vikings (History Channel) and Homeland (Showtime Channel).

After catching up recently, I am still pretty confused about where things are and what's what culturally, but it doesn't matter - one need not have it all figured out to appreciate the real stories, which are the relationships between the people, not the cities or clans.

The names are hard to remember, and again, it doesn't matter. It's still interesting even though I can't remember many of the names.

It fascinates me that the writer is still working out the future of this series - the books are not all written - so even the book fans do not know what is going to happen, ultimately.

Is it a spoiler to say that above all, I cannot wait to see... oh, yes, that would be a spoiler... starts with a D.

Note to HBO: WOW!!! AMAZING sets, costuming, overall production scale is absolutely stunning, the crew and producers should be extremely proud of what you have created."
932,"First, the book's author, George R.R. Martin, was very much involved (as series writer & co- executive producer) in the HBO series' creation (which is likely why it's taken so long for him to release the next book in A Song of Ice and Fire). And second, the serial format is ideal for maintaining fidelity to the spirit of Martin's wonderful story. A major challenge faced by the creators of the Lord of the Rings (LotR) films was the amount of material they had to cull from Toliken's epic tale in order to fit into three relatively short films. The serial format provided by HBO eliminates this problem. In fact, nothing would please me more than to see a PROPER adaptation of LotR filmed in this way. Another pleasing aspect of this series is the obvious devotion to quality. By hiring a world class production designer (Gemma Jackson) and a slate of top-notch English actors, the creators of Game of Thrones have been able to re-create Martin's world in a beautiful and convincing way."
933,"This show is a mixture of action, suspense, unexpected events, love, hate, brutality, revenge, it is a mixture of all the epic's in one place, the first season till episode 5 it is little hard to understand, but once u pass by 5, the real flavor of got comes into action, love this to core, recommended to watch at any cost, better than every other TV show guaranteed, I myself didn't like to see this show because of the mythology and all, but i am happy that, i am a part of got family, lucky enough to live in this era...watch at any cost, Indians or the whole world..."
934,"After GoT , I cannot watch any TV shows, the others feel empty . Such characters ( and they are not afraid to kill any of them ) , great story, incredible quality ( better than most of the movies ) , although not 100% compatible with the books It is almost 90% compatible ... Just perfect. I do not know how to summarise this but I am practically in love with the series. I hope same people will make a LoTR TV series."
935,"I loved the show from the very first episode and i could not stop. after 24 hours i have seen the first season and wanted more. too bad i had to wait a couple of months until season 2 was out. but what happened then was strange. i totally forgot about the show until shortly before the start of season 6. because of that i rewatched season 1 and then continued with season 2 - 5 in less than a week before season 6 started. i was shocked why i waited so long to continue watching it. the characters are interesting, the storyline always surprises you, the list of the great things is endless. the show is very well written and the cast is perfectly chosen. there are characters you immediately love and some you immediately hate. at the beginning its very clear who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. but over a couple of seasons this is getting more and more mixed up since everyone has their own agenda and like in real life no one is really only good or only evil and the actions of the characters are often unpredictable. whats also interesting about this show is that with season 1 it starts incredibly high in terms of quality and storytelling and it stays this way until today. this is quite rare. most shows either improve or decline after a couple of seasons but this one stays always on top which is a very hard thing to pull off, although season 6 might have taken a couple of shortcuts here and there. A realistic Rating would be something like 9.3 to 9.5."
936,"I didn't think I would be such a fan of this series because I'm not big on fantasy. But Game of thrones has it all.

Epic drama

Epic fights

Epic story lines

Epic back-stories (without having to do FLASHBACKS)

Epic characters

Brilliant humour

And epic sex.

It takes a while to get into because there are literally hundreds of characters that get introduced, but they all serve an entertaining and significant purpose until they eventually die an incredible death.

It's easily one of the best shows on television at the moment, because it has something for everyone, and did I mention it's rather epic? Just don't watch it with your kids."
937,"I have only recently come across this series and was surprised to hear it was based on a book. I myself am a lord of the rings lover and I am very into my fantasy films. To make a book into a TV series has been done but not usually to great success, however out of the two episodes which I have watched I think that it is a great triumph and core-graphed very well. The actors and actresses used in the series are choice of great people who all play there parts very well and have hooked me to the series. As I did not read the books I do not know whether it sticks to the same storyline but from what I have heard they have done it very well."
938,"The show is good, so much better than many shows on TV, but there's room for improvement.

What this show was meant to be, is

---> 1. a Sopranos type drama

---> 2. with many great characters,

---> 3. plenty of amazing twists, evil and tragedy

---> 4. and many Lord-of-the-Rings-mixed-with-Horror type battles.

The books set up nice and then deliver. A TV show unfortunately can't deliver all. Some things are cut due to budget. Some things are added for titillation (although there's plenty of sex in the original story already).

So what you get is

---> 1. a Sopranos type drama

---> 2. with many good characters (whose introduction can become a drag, because this is not a book)

---> 3. plenty of amazing twists (latter half of the series), evil and tragedy

---> 4. and BOOBIES

---> 5. And some fight scenes and implied battles.

Still good, stick with it.

The story is great and makes up for the lacking Lord-of-the-Rings type battles.

My biggest pet peeve? Pacing.

The acting is really good (Sean Bean! The kids! Awesome!), but the pacing sometimes feels unbalanced.

And I don't mean the snail's pace of the first episodes. That is needed, unfortunately.

I mean there's an awkward pacing between the scenes. This series has yet to grow comfortable with itself, find a balance between it's ideal version and the TV/constrained version.

I'm rooting for season two anyway."
939,"After the first slower paced episodes this amazing series takes of. You've gotten to know the different characters and are about to set off on an amazing journey.

The beautiful landscapes and wonderful sets alone are reason enough to watch. But it is the story it self that is the key. True to the books it was based on, with twists and turns at every corner make it a must see.

The scripting and the actors make this story come to life and keep us glued to the television! I've always loved reading fantasy novels, but seeing a book come to live like the game of thrones makes me want more. It looks, feels and almost smells like how i've imagined it while reading.

I can only say ... thank you and make more"
940,"Everyone comments on how great this show is. I agree. The scenery and casting is very good. Mr. Martin has some awesome conten - I have read the books and the casting is very reflective of the books. Overall, its a nice show to watch with family or significant others. Do yourself a favor and watch!"
941,"In most cases I find IMDb ratings fairly real, but this is absolutely not the case!

Where should I start? Well, I don't know if the people who gave this show 10 stars have ever watched any REALLY great series so I'm hoping that this is the first show they've ever watched and they don't know what 10 stars should represent. I feel really sad when I see those 10 stars, sad for the people I mean. Don't even want to think about medical (psychic) issues they must've got, even though they are pretty obvious... Just to be clear, I don't mind them giving it 10 stars but that misleads other people who come here to check out what's good for watching.

About the show, the idea behind the story sounds great when you hear it - seven noble families BATTLE for the crown. Yes, BATTLE!!! Well, if I'm not mistaken, there has been 30 episodes so far and maybe 4 or 5 out of 30 includes the mentioned BATTLES. But, that's just the beginning, those couple of episodes mostly consist of people going to battle and people coming from battle. Basically, you watch and wait through 8-9 episodes (out of 10) to see the battle (finally) and it lasts 2-3 minutes. See the problem? If not, make an appointment at your doctor... And for those saying that the scams and other b.s. is worth the rating, Mexican telenovelas are being filmed for decades (if scams are what you're into) so check out their ratings...

I won't go into spoiling the story, I'll just explain my rating:

10 - boring as hell - total lack of battles (which all is about) - useless hours of character descriptions - it's following the book so 10 stars = 6

Anyway, if you're into watching lots of TV series like me, it's watchable like The walking dead (oh the boredom since season 2), Dexter (rule no.1 never get caught - caught every season), and similar. You know, great ideas - bad production. But it's OK cause time does pass by while watching it.

And remember, this is a watcher review - not a blinded book fan so it should be of help, at least I hope so.

P.S. I think that the Spartacus crew would have made this to be one of the best series ever, but sadly it's HBO working on it..."
942,"Too lengthy. Could have been completed in 2 seasons, total 12 episodes. Unnecessary violence."
943,"I honestly got hooked since the first episode.

It was strange at first but by the time you finished one episode, you'll stay up for the next 72 hrs just to watch the whole thing.

Enough said!

Anyone who haven't seen it yet. Don't watch it. GOT will ruin television for you. Just saying 😉"
944,Finesse. Captivates through its various techniques of expressing real life events skilfully.
945,Nice introduction for season 8 its awsommmmmme Just in every aspect the details the story everything!!!!
946,I watched this TV show first time in 2016.My friend suggest me to watch before I hadn't know about it.And then I had watched 1 episode I was surprised I couldn't wait to see what happened next 'cause of suspense and I started watching continuously then I think within a 5 days I had completed all the episodes of all seasons.Now I am curious to see the last and final season 8 and I know that It will be full of suspense lots of surprises and many more.
947,Best show of all time !!! Will miss it badly hope the prequel to this is worth the same ... Jon Snow aka Aegon Targeryen King Of GOT
948,This is going to be the best show you'll ever watch. It contains all that you need.
949,"Game of thrones! Is single handedly the greatest show I've ever seen! The plot, characters and the gripping story line. There is a lot of episodes and we were very weary of starting as there are so many but once you start you just simply cannot stop, it took us a month of one after the other. Excellent show!!"
950,Honestly gonna cry for a long time when it ends ! It's just so fascinating. And amazing how big the fan base has become and how far it's reached
951,This is the best show to appear on television it is one hell of a great show
952,"This is my first ever review of any movie or show. I been coming to IMDB for about 4 years and never thought to make a comment about any movie or show,but now one of the greatest shows of all time is ending. Game of Thrones is in its final season,with simply 6 episodes remaining in movie length to fulfill the ""Throne"". Besides ""The Sopranos "" this is by far in my opinion the greatest show ever done by HBO...The fantasy of such a prolific drama and suspense is ending, ""Winter is coming "" and if you have not watched a single episode,I strongly urge you too binge on the seven seasons prior,you will not be disappointed. George R.R. Martins epic story is beautifully brought to light by David nutter and David Benoiff in a direction of excellence. In my opinion ""Game of Thrones "" is in one word ""PERFECTION """
953,"One of the very best shows on TV.

It's obvious that JRRM is a student of European history Wars & Machiavellian strategy and the old school ways of dispatching your opponents.

JRRM hasn't balked at writing difficult or controversial books input to scenes because the culture at the time wasn't ready to embrace it - spoiler it is now!

n.b. I say one of the best because as with all things it must end, and there is life after GOT - The Winter of our discontent is coming!"
954,Perfect on plot Perfect on cast Perfect on sound Perfect on cinematography Perfect on make-up and prosthetics.. Just PERFECT!
955,"Absolutely amazing show,each episode leaves you dangling with all the different twists."
956,It was fascinating. I've bought the book and I like it too
957,Amazing!! You gotta watch this. This has everything and anything. I wish they should release this in theater.
958,"GOT (Game of Thrones. (Duh!!)) is by far one of the most amazing TV series adapted from a series of books that I have truly ever seen. Of course this is my opinion but one that many share.

This series is in my top three favorite. I don't want to give anything away so I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but I do recommend watching it. In the very least you must try the first three episodes. As a rule of thumb give any show the first three episodes and give any book the first three chapters."
959,There's no words to describe this show!!!!!! it's remarkable
960,I have watch this show 8 times and its still good i wont Say anything about the show because this is somthing you med to watch without knowing anything !
961,"Amazing series, the story telling is incredible and the camera work sublime. Such a huge scale, scenery, characters and story. Some scenes are truly gob smacking. This is one I'm sure everyone will take something away from and enjoy. So excited for the final season, can not wait!!!! Really next level stuff."
962,"Loved every season of GOT, brilliant cast, brilliant story, so much depth to this, just gets better and better season by season, had everything you could possibly want in a series and more...! If only they could continue the story after season 8...! Looking forward to the prequel now..! If you haven't seen GOT... what are you playing it..!? Like really.!!"
963,But aemilia is not engaged?yes..because I would like to marry her! Emilia if you read this message run in Italy because I'll marry you instantly!
964,"The last season trailer is trying to deceive us.What i m trying to say,in the Wintefell crypts what is comming to Snow and Aria and Sansa is not danger but help. The think that s coming from the krupts is the last line of defence the first men and the children of the forest have put to save Westeros in case the White Walkers ever came back(maybe just maybe the last line of defence to White walkers is the similar thing but to them,you fight fire with fire, whites with withes)...so wha HBO trying to do is to deceive us."
965,"This is the best show on television period! The plot lines, the characters, the sets and how they string it all together. This is by far my favorite show forever. Thanks HBO for making it. Can't wait to see what you come up with for a spin off cause there's no way this ends."
966,"I didn't start watching until earlier this year. I can't say exactly why as it had all of the elements of movies or shows I normally like. Maybe I had too much going on at the time it began. Maybe it was because there was so much hype that I didn't think it could live up to it. But I just finished season 4 and I have to say all of the accolades are well deserved. Everything about this series...the cast, the complexity of the storytelling and how seamlessly it flows, the drama, the action, the cinematography...is amazing. I can't wait to watch seasons 5-7 before the final one airs."
967,Incredible !! 😍 Never Seen Before HatsOff to the Cast and crew to the directors and offcourse George RR Martin 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌☺
968,"This show alone sets the standard for TV shows, I have not watched anything as gripping since The Wire. The complex plots, twists, and characters are all part of a massive web of storylines. Fantastic! Keep it coming."
969,"Shakespeare could have never written such a complex, immersive, masterpiece. There have been lulls here and there but every action and subplot seems to have the most brilliant intertwined purpose. The actors give every character such life that it becomes part of your day to day being. As the intricate web of destiny becomes unwound to its final conclusion, you wonder if Game of Thrones will find its final chapter in a movie theater. The story couldn't be more rich and deserving than to eventually become the biggest movie in cinema history"
970,"Best series ever. Most complicated plot of any series, and still makes sense."
971,"I think this is probably one of the best TV shows ever made, and I highly recommend it to everyone, (but read the books first, seriously.) which is no wonder since it's an adaptation of the greatest book series that I, and many others, have read. That's just what this show is, an adaptation. It's fine to make some smaller changes here and there and I love most of the original TV scenes that weren't in the books, like Littlefinger and Varys' conversations, Robert and Cersei, Cersei and Joffrey, that White Walker scene with Craster's baby in The land of always Winter, I mean, that's just amazing! I'm okay if the show does some different things as long as it doesn't just completely do it's own thing, which they started doing eventually. The show starts off fantastically and it's almost just like if you were reading the books, only that it was made somewhat differently for TV. The characters are basically all there and the casting was excellent, the plot and the story was totally nailed and we all knew that the show was in good hands, it was almost perfect. Season one was pretty much the way they should have kept the show going but it seems that the show got worse when they tried to change things. They changed many things, cut and completely altered several characters (changed their names even, like wut?) Some bad changes happened in season 2 already, like the Daenerys' Quarth plot, her dragons, Xaro Xhoan Daxos and the house of the undying as well. They should have stuck with the characters' story lines, (just naming a few names here:) like Gendry, Edric Storm, Thoros of Myr, Melisandre, The Hound, Brienne/Podrick (and many of the traveling companions/foes they meet on their quest), Bronn (especially), the Tully family (Cat, Edmure and Brynden) and their relationship, Hoster Tully, who was mostly cut from the show, and so much more that I could just write an essay about it. One of the things the show seems to do is, instead of just introducing new characters like in the books, they just merge their plotlines together and sometimes they're part of things they weren't part of in the books. Even though the show does this, it does, however, get a lot of things right and it works pretty well as a whole, I just wish they'd stop changing things... Like the title says, the first four seasons were amazing, to great. I praise the first season the most because it's most faithful to the books, the other three seasons were great as well however, but then we get to season five, and onwards, and everything just goes crazy. The first two books fitted in one season each, S1 and S2. Book three was actually split up in two seasons, S3 and S4! Which was just great, but I wonder if they could have actually made three. Then we get to book four, and five. Yep, they made book four and five into one single season, when they should have done three. Season five should have been for book four, and seasons six and seven should have been for book five (parts 1 and 2). I can't (curse word) believe that they made season five that way, book five is almost just as long as book three, which got two seasons! In my opinion, the should have just stuck with making a book adaptation instead of going completely off the rails (or should I say, off the books?) with seasons 6 and onward. They should have stopped at season 7, probably, when they were done with the book adaptations, and waited with patience for Georgie boy to finish book six, just like we book fans have been doing since 2011. Meanwhile, they could have made spinoff series like they're planning on doing right now so it wouldn't be completely dead to people. That would have worked! People would just have to be a little more Patient, like us! They could have made book six into two or three seasons, since it's gonna be so incredibly long (1500 pages!!) and then wait for book seven, which I am very doubtful will be released in the near future, if ever. Overall it's a great show, and I know this isn't IMDBooks but seriously, you should read the books first. I'm giving it a strong 9 / 10, close to 10 / 10, the first four seasons alone are just that good but then season five, six and seven came along and it GoT worse. I would probably rate the books a 10+ / 10, just saying!... Go read them now..."
972,"A series filled with exceptional characters, dialog, action, scenery, and score. The later seasons weaken slightly compared to the earlier ones due to the fact that they surpassed the most recent book, but they still move the story forward in a great way. Don't miss out on arguably the best Drama series in Television history."
973,Very addictive. The storyline can be complicated and intricate. Makes for a great series. Cant wait of the last season!
974,I'm sad that game of thrones is ending and excited and can't wait to see season 8 and how it will begin and end the suspense has been killing me so starting today 12/22/2018 I will watch every episode til season 8 begins. I also can't wait to See the prequel also. LIVE THE GAME & LOVE THE THRONE!
975,"#forthethrone it's just, game of the edge of your seat, game of the most amazing actors, game of best twists. When that intro starts you just hum along (or scream in my case) with excitement. Oh right, game of best intros. Just watch it. If you haven't who are you really?"
976,"Game of Thrones is revolves about certain characters vying to get control over the fictional world, and the domino effects those desires have created, driving the whole story forward. The story is mainly set in a world similar to the European Middle-Ages, but with magic.

Game of Thrones has A LOT of characters that I cant even remember the names of 90% of them. Because of the HUGE world, the story is expected to be usually dragging during the first half of the season as it tries to set-up the final episodes-- which I will tell you are truly magnificent! Even the earlier seasons are set-up for the grand final season that will surely be one of the best final episodes in the history of modern television series.

If you are a fan of shows that deal with politics, fantasy, family, drama, and intrigue, you definitely need to see Game of Thrones."
977,Best tv show ever! Hope that last season is the same.
978,"Bigger, better and more believable than the Bible."
979,"Well, I'm sure that if I started watching that series with its season one premiere in 2011, I wasn't going to keep watching it! It was so boring as a big series, but fortunately, I was underage, so last year -after I got registered- I bought it. But I got bored, because of season one, then I stopped watching it, and then I watched it again and I loved it! Glad that I didn't miss the 'Game'!

Sorry for the long intro. Let's get now to season one of Game of Thrones...

I'm a big fan of George R.R. Martin's books, a Song of Ice and Fire! And HBO made a great TV adaption, with the details, performances, scenery, cast, costumes and every-single-thing! HBO's GoT made me love it, more than the books it-selves! But it didn't do that fast, it took 6 episodes to be a routine of mine. After 6 episodes, GoT became something I must do everyday, literately!

The slow storytelling in this season, bothered me to hell! 6 episodes with nothing, and then some interesting things in episode 7,,same in episode 8, and then the two saviors of the season, episode 9 and the season finale!

That's my only and biggest problem with this season.. so after the salvation of this season, I'm gonna give it an 8/10.

Now with the -not very- step forward season, season two... As I said, it's not a very step forward, but it's defiantly better than the first one!

It had a slow storytelling, but not like the first season, and the saviors this time, saved it very well!

The CGI of episode 9 was brilliant... BTW, this episode was the best in this season.

So the performance is definitely better than the first one, and the story got richer, actually!

So GoT season two is better and more effective than season one! I'm gonna give it a 9/10.

And now season three... It has the same problems with season two, the only difference is the improved CGI, that's all!

So until now, GoT has the same problem, but it's getting improved, for that I'm gonna give GoT season three 9/10, just like the second season for me.

A huge step forward for GoT! Season four is totally -with no dout- amazing and perfectly made!

Loved every single episode of it! Everything was just perfect, even the soundtrack was very awesome! They really got attention for every detail. They didn't make any mistake, literately! I didn't feel any boredom in this season, not even once!

The CGI was more even better than the three previous seasons! And episode 9 was totally freaking out!! The direction, soundtrack,performances and the CGI, made it the best episode in this entire series!

Season 4 is definitely great, with memorable moments and great soundtrack and CGI! GoT season 4 deserves a 10/10!

After having a great time with season 4, back again to the same problem with the first 3 seasons.. BOREDOM! And I thought that I will never feel it again, after season 4. But here we are again, poor stuff happening, until episode 7!

It actually went worse than the first one in those 7 episode, but once again they needed a savior, but this time their saviors were totally powerful, especially episode 8!

Because of their three saviors, I liked this season, but stills, a big step back! So, season five will get an 8/10.

They got awake, and hit us with the second best season of the series, season 6.

This season is very epic and entertaining indeed, but it's not like season 4, because season 4 had everything under-control, but season missed the soundtrack, but stills a fascinating season though! And again -finally- they didn't need a savior!

Every-episode was fighting to be the best in the season, and episode 9 won, but stills not special like S4 E9.

So GoT is back again with a big hit season! Season 6 absolutely deserves a 10/10!

And now, the latest season, season 7. This season was definitely epic, gore and amazing! The problem here ain't boredom, it's some missing elements!

The sexual content is totally lost, the violence is down and the battle in episode 6 wasn't so epic, but it was good though! But it has a very stupid thing, how the White Walkers brought the dragon?!

So because of the missing elements, season 7 went down! Got season 7 gets a 9/10.

So Game of Thrones is my favorite series of all the time, so far! And I can't wait for the series finale! Game of Thrones gets a 9/10."
980,The best tv seires i have ever watched.the plot and the way characterisation is done evrything is incrdible.just you cant predict the outcome at any point of time.go for it
981,"This show never failed to surprise me with the amazing plot twists and unexpected betrayals. I absolutely love that it shows the story of every big character in the show, rather than just mention the character a few times and let us imagine their personality based on stories we hear. I recommend it to anyone no matter your genre preference"
982,"Unexpected and surprising which is what makes it so good. Great acting, great special effects and a fantastic storyline. Gutted we have to wait so long for the last season but know it will be worth it."
983,Excelent. You actually have fellings for the characters. There is so much going on and the story is perfect. Excelent actors and excellent CGI. It will be interesting to see how they will end it
984,"Something for everyone here and as soon as you start watching it you won't be able to stop, it is soooo addictive and unpredictable and never has a dull moment in it. However people's descriptions of the series may sound bizarre and down putting actually watching the show will show you how amazing it really it. I promise you that you will not be disappointed and that you will wonder why you didn't start watching it years ago."
985,I did not want to love this show!!!!!!! But here I am in the IMDB reviews section proclaming to the world that I AM IN LOVE WITH JOHN SNOW.. Ugh... I mean GOT... hehe. Great story telling & wonderful sets. I love it so much.
986,"This is one of the most beautiful done tv shows on tv right now. I only started watching it in 2015 but ever since I can't wait for the next season.

The actors do their job so well, and I'm actually very interested what happens to them, unlike in other shows where I feel indifference towards the characters. The storyline is very intriguing and I never felt like it was cringey or in any way stupid.

Something I have seen other reviews mention is that season 7 was a bit more rushed than the other ones, they being more slow-paced. I definitely agree, but I don't think that it was bothersome. The slow pace of the storyline bothered me in the first few seasons, and I was grateful that season 7 was somewhat rushed, as it concentrated on the most important aspects of the show.

Love it and definitely recommend it. 10.5/10"
987,"It will keep you locked to your screen, you can't miss a second of the show as every moment has its meaning. The events are unpredictable which leaves you sometimes in shock but you can't have enough of it."
988,"The best TV show I ever seen, I love it so much........"
989,Visuals from castles are a proof of the achievements in our hearts of this epic Television Show called 'Game Of Thrones.' The seven seasons are filled with adult content and successful achievements by actors who like 'Jon Snow' trained entire day: a shot in the 'Battle of The Bastards' took cinematographers to shoot a visual of seconds an entire day; repeating the shot throughout the day. The micro and macro reality is that the show has lived: budget and profits have made the television show a success and we recommend the TV program for users. International Movie Data Base has millions of users rating this TV show which like an epidemic; crossed the middle-ages to twenty first century with action figures like of 'Jon' in our homes. The assessment of relationships in 'Game of Thrones' is an English nightmare like the Kings who lived in castles across the English speaking worlds but they created us who speak the language.
990,"A game of life and death. This is, without doubt, the fantasy drama of the decade. Full of action and adventure, visual splendour and superb and sometimes unpredictable characters.

Very difficult to fault this as an overall series. Some episodes are less memorable than others, but across as many seasons, this is totally understandable. Many scenes will be engraved in your mind.

With the superb acting and the dramatic scenery, you are easily immersed in the kingdoms. As the characters develop, you feel real empathy towards some and hatred towards others. Love them or loathe them, no character is immune from the axe, quite literally.

From moments of tenderness, to gut wrenching shock and horror, this story has everything. If you haven't done so already, watch it from start to finish, you won't be disappointed!"
991,Excellent series and excessively close to the books.
992,Best of all best TV series lot suspnse thrill romance love conspiracy friendship and many more in this list a must watch show
993,The Absolute Best . Will go down in TV history as one of the most visually groundbreaking show in its time
994,"Got to say it, reading some of the reviews with people giving thrones 1/10 is a joke, maybe it's not for everyone but giving it a one out of 1/10 slow minded fools, 10/10 absolutely the best tv show on earth"
995,Great show!! You either hate or love the characters!
996,"Itz simply the best show i have ever seen. To b honest,for the level GOT has got me in, all other shows in same genre seem less interesting as compared against GOT. The best part abt this show is the pilot twist, seriously, wat ever u r anticipating about the flow of story line, dont keep ur hopes high. The actors are doing incredibly great job especially,peter dinklage. u gotta love to like the gud portraying characters nd hate the villains. Hatsoff to the writer of books(George R R Martin), producers,Directors,And actors. I gotta say ""There is not ,there never was nd there never b a show as great as GAME OF THRONES""."
997,"Very very interesting show made for real entertainment. You will love every episode. excellent vfx, acting, screen play, locations."
998,This show is simply awesome The plot is interesting The charcters are amazing The cast are the best
999,"This show has the best television has to offer. Good story, CGI, acting, direction, set and music, this is closest you can get to perfection. That being said, season 4-6 were, in my opinion, not the best. The progress of the story during these seasons was too slow for my taste. It got tedious to watch through entire series, but glad I got through them. Season 7 was a blast, lot of reveals and the lore getting closer to its conclusion. Eagerly waiting for final season."
1000,Season 1 through 4 are 10/10 5 through 7 are good but not on the same level 8/10 One of my favourite tv shows of all time can't wait for season 8!
1001,"To be honest ..out of all the TV series i watched, my brain and heart never felt anything about it while watching this show. Emotions go so high and goosebumps catches me so often that i have thought several times to be a part of it, no matter if only for 5 min!

From the first episode to the last of season 7, it has been a remarkably well directed, edited and performed TV series! From blue eyes of the dead to the cold snowy effects, from flying dragons to a touch of blade, from knights and lords and witches and castles and .. ah there is just so much in it that it gets on the nerves very easily but wont get off so quietly !

All I can say that all of the actors deserve a lot of applaud for their stunning performances and the visual effects are at the very best !Keep up the superb work as it will come to an end after-all but i am glad that i will have all of it saved and i will watch it from the beginning like a treat .. yes i will watch it like 3 episodes in a row in one sitting :P

That would be fun !

This 7th Season .. Its getting into me like a drug .. and i think i am addicted to the screams of dragons and the looks of the queen ! I cannot wait to watch the wall and listen to the best of the written dialogues in the present century for a tale that never existed ! Its like it has no flaws at all .. no error ! Everything is happening on its right time, every time the dragons appear its like ohhhh yeahhhh bring it on !!! And its sad that the end is near.

I have hundreds of ideas for the producers to keep this show running but may be its better to finish it off to make a history here for English TV serials !!"
1002,"""When you play the game of thrones, you win, or you die. There is no middle ground"" (Cersei Lannister, Game of Thrones). Game of Thrones is a spectacular TV show that has unexpectedly drawn me into its complex world, and I highly encourage anyone who enjoys great acting and imaginative story-lines to watch this television show. Game of Thrones is set in a medieval land where good and evil are at a constant struggle and seven kingdoms fight for control. Well- developed characters face harrowing challenges and embark on quests full of death and glory, which categorize Game of Thrones as an adventure-drama. When I watch an adventure-drama, I expect to see exciting scenes of action unfold and plot lines that develop and take unexpected turns. I want to be engaged in the action as much as the dialogue and expect to see character development throughout. Game of Thrones is sure to keep you entertained for it includes: stylized action, drama, and fantasy. ""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention"" (Ramsey Snow, Game of Thrones). I rate Game of Thrones 10 out of 10 stars. My expectations are met each time I watch the show as the plot progresses and action unfolds. Main characters face challenging ordeals and often meet their deaths in the vicious, yet realistic, fictional world of Westeros. Strong violence and upsetting content drives the dark tone of the show, which helps make it an even better drama."
1003,"Game of Thrones's comeback was awesome, amazing plots, awesome characters and again awesome dialogue and writing, Dan Weiss and Benioff do some nice works on converging the story-lines and i am okay with it, no way they would squish 1000 pages of a book in 10 hours, they do a fine work with what they can, and GoT is their gold mine. Wish a better season than the last one."
1004,"George R. R. Martins fantasy world is unlike any world setting you have ever seen.

This fantasy series will not have your typical hero which will defeat the evil of this world. In fact you could argue that everyone in this world setting is egoistic and a bit evil. Unlike in Lord of the Rings you can not be sure what will happen and who will survive. This is what George achieved. You are always anxious about whether or not your favorite character will die. The series portrays the harshness of war in the real world. Heroes and innocent people die. There are lies, greed and jealousy all over Westeros. The producers of GoT achieved the immersion of this fantasy world. As soon as the epic intro begins you are in Westeros, you feel for your favorite characters and of course you are afraid that they may die because of this is war. The series follows the book closely but in the end the producers had to create their own path. I disliked some of the choices in the last season but what could you expect from the producers. The author couldn't finish it in time and now we expect them to finish such a vast and complicated story in a much shorter time.

If you want to see a Lord of the Rings series with more aggression, blood and most importantly political games, then Game of Thrones is certainly something for you."
1005,"Lately when it comes to TV shows a lot of shows have started off great but end up going down hill after a few seasons. However game of thrones isn't one of them. It does have some slow paced episodes and slow build up but it's still worth watching. The action, shock value and violence is mind blowing. The dark tone, locations, costumes CGI and make up effects for the white walkers are visually amazing. Casting choice for characters is great. Not only is this probably one of the best TV shows but one of the best medieval dramas. It deserves the high praise and rating it has. Just wish other TV shows I watch could be as great, clever and enjoyable as game of thrones."
1006,"What a tremendous show this is ? I would give a 10/10 to this show and the best one I have seen. HBO produces shows that last in memories for a long time. My favorite character is Daenerys Stormborn. She came out of no where and just gave an inspirational journey to remember. Its been just 4 seasons and I simply can't wait for the 5th. The show follows the book in a great way although there are some changes but its alright as books and shows cannot be completely same. I love this show and would urge HBO to produce epic fantasy shows like ""GAME OF THRONES"". If shows like GAME OF THRONES, BREAKING BAD , DEXTER and PRISON BREAK continue though they are the masterpieces of different channels people would have nothing to do in the world except blow their minds of with such tremendous performances of the actors, the direction of the directors and definitely the writers . George R R Martin is a class."
1007,"Perhaps the most complete comprehensive and epic narrative in the history of television. Adapted from George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" the series takes us through to the land of Westeros where medieval feudalism and misguided chivalry exist in tandem, where five major families fight for the control of the ""Iron Throne"". Filled with honor and betrayal, complete with dragons to zombies- this show promises to get better even more. When King Robert comes all the way to the North- the ancient kingdom of the Starks to seek help from his best mate Ned Stark, the honorable Lord decides to comply. The Queen is a Lannister- the villainous among the Great Families. Elsewhere the remaining siblings of the deposed Targaryens are also preparing to get their kingdom back. In this whirlwind of events starts the first episode. Truly speaking its very hard to leave your seat from then on. After the Sopranos' comes another masterpiece from HBO. Not seen it yet- well frankly you're really something. Coz' its simply the best."
1008,"This is truly one of the best, if not the best, TV-shows I have ever seen. It mixes great drama with powerful action. The actors are all very well casted and their performances are topnotch! The storyline is very fresh from other TV series, of course we all know that George R.R. Martin kills a lot of main characters but that is what makes the series different, there are still lots of unexpected plot twists and great dialogues in this series. The only thing what keeps me from rating this series a 10 is the fact that they change directors every few episodes, all directors are great but they film in a different way therefor making each episode with a different director slightly ""different"" than the others.

But this is still one of the best series ever made and I will encourage everyone to see it!"
1009,"For those who don't know by now The Game of Thrones on HBO is a TV adaption of George R.R. Martin's books, a Song of Ice and Fire.

If you've never read or watched fantasy and you hate the genre you should give A Game of Thrones a Chance anyway Because Unlike most fantasy Books and shows this isn't packed with magic and magical creatures expect for the ""others"" and one or two other creatures this Series is more like a Drama/Thriller with plenty of backstabbing,double and triple crosses the political intrigue will leave you wanting more and more.

for those who think the story line is too complex it shouldn't be it's actually quite simple and clean.

yes there are a lot of characters to keep up with but once you've watched the first season you will slide into to it comfortably.

only advice I can give someone who is watching for the first time is to start with season 1 episode 1 because you will be lost if you don't.

PS:I would try not to get too attached to any ""one"" character. In other words try and pick out four or five to be your favorite......"
1010,"Game of Thrones is an epic show like no other. Based on George R.R Martin's book series this show allows fantasy to take a large leap into reality. From the outset of this series the pace is nonstop and heart stopping. Viewers have to keep up with all the drama, action and cold hearted maneuvers as the noble families compete for the Iron Throne and rule of the seven kingdoms. Families believe the throne and power is rightfully theirs as they scheme and try to overthrow each other. However that is not the only war going on as the ancient White Walkers have emerged that threaten the very existence of the living. When the main lead, Eddard Stark (Sean Bean), was killed in the first season fans were bluntly made aware that this series is unlike any other they have ever seen. Heroes and villains fall when you least expect them. The harsh realities of living in this realm are never sugarcoated, you see everything.

What also makes this show stand far above the rest of its contemporaries is the gut wrenching cliff hangers it has produced over the years. Just when you think a character is safe his fate is sealed. Iconic episodes such as the red wedding is evidence of that, you are thrown a curve ball when you least expect it so it is best to not get too attached to a character. The high quality episodes we are treated to tell us that this is a well thought of and beautifully crafted show. Watching episodes you can effortlessly move through the events and stories without having too many doubts. It is as if the producers planned this show with absolute precision. So far in 10 episodes per season this show has spoken volumes. The high quality has been maintained in this series from the first episode making it an epic series.

The producers have excelled in transporting viewers to a different and magical realm or world. You feel and experience the drama as it unfolds. Almost every episode is hard to put down, you simply don't take a break when watching Game of Thrones. You anticipate each new episode and quickly go through it without realizing it.

This show is one for the ages. As a show that has created iconic season finales, amazing characters, realms, story lines and suspense Game of Thrones has no equal in these respects. It is no surprise it is universally acclaimed and so highly rated.

Game of Thrones is easily the best television series in modern times."
1011,"if you have 1month left of your life, stay home and watch Game of Thrones. Totally worth it.

Nothing in the world of TV series can compare to GoT. It was brilliant work piece ever. 10/10.

my life is complete."
1012,"As a life-long fan of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game, it is a hard thing to not be familiar with the ""Game of Thrones"" series. And yet it took me five years after the pilot to start watching it. But it should be said, then, that I haven't been able to stop watching it since I started, and I have sat through four of the seasons so far in a very short time.

What works for me in ""Game of Thrones"" is the extensive storyline, with multiple houses working against one another or with one another all in order to obtain power, wealth and the crown to the realm. But also the myriad of intricate and detailed characters that are in the series, that is just spectacular. Especially because anyone of these characters can die on a whim, so you never know who is safe.

The costumes are sets are fantastic, especially because there is so much attention to detail, both mundane and flashy. And it really works out so well, because you really think that you are in a medieval fantasy setting with dragons and knights. And also the special effects play a big role in the series, although not the point where the show is dependent on the special effects. Of course, having good CGI is particularly important if the dragons were to be realistic and believable.

I like the politics and the alliances and feuds between the different houses and affiliations, because it is played out so well, and it is really well thought through by the creator.

One thing that really is a thorn in my side if the excessive amount of nudity in the show, because it really sleazes up the series unnecessarily. The show would work out equally well with much less nudity and done in a more presentable way. But also the constant excessive use of foul language; here I am thinking of the ""F-word"" and the ""C-word"" that most of the characters are using frequently. It really seems out of place with the setting and atmosphere of the series, plus is also adds a wholly unnecessary level of unpleasantness. I am not a prude, but I think it is so frequent in the series that it is a downright annoyance.

You quickly find your favorite character or characters in the myriad of colorful, quirky, scheming, bold, defiant and lovable characters. And likewise, you also quickly find ones that you most definitely do not like or even downright loathe. For me, the King Joffrey character was one that I instantly despised, he really pulled every wrong string in my being. Nothing against Jack Gleeson as an actor, it was just the character that he portrayed. And as such, when a series manages to instill such a relationship between the viewer and fictional characters, then the series is really worth watching, appealing to you on more than just an entertainment level.

The slow build up of various events, and how the events have effects on the various houses and factions like ripples in a pond, really add enjoyment to the show. And you want to see more and learn what will happen next and see how the epic tale unfolds. Who will live and who will die? Who will stand victorious when the dust settles?

""Game of Thrones"" is really worth watch, especially if you enjoy the fantasy genre. I am rating it a solid eight out of ten stars, and the reason for it not scoring nine or even ten stars from me is solely because of the unnecessary nudity and foul language."
1013,"I had watch hundred of shows in my life. But, GoT is the greatest show I ever watched in my life. I had so much attachment with each character. The GoT would be the legacy and trademark of HBO. They keep true to the epically written book, and they depict the characters in an excellent way. With a few exceptions I would say they have made what will be an epic show here, and I would really hope that they continue for all the books. The main problem is, that if you don't know the books you are quite lost with the characters and what happened to all of them. But I hope we will get deeper into the minds and backgrounds of those people! The cast for that is really well done and I hope for they can pass on the feelings I got when I read the book!"
1014,"When we talk of greatness, this show would be a perfect definition for such word. The execution of all the artists with their respective character based from the novel by Sir George RR Martin is just undeniably scientific. The interpretation and processing thoughts or the writers of this show are just intelligent. This is a show about human life drawn into the world of fantasy. Politics at its finest. This is a mind-blowing piece of art, really. It contains shocking revelation and twists which you cannot anticipate, for real. I am seriously attached with this magnificent TV series. And if you haven't watch this show yet, better do it now before you die. For we all know that ""valar morghulis""."
1015,"With six full seasons gone and the seventh about to start, I can finally put to rest any concerns that this series could not do justice to a series of novels that boast incredibly complex, interwoven plot-lines, deep and complete character development over long periods, and a fantasy/medieval setting of amazing detail and imagination.

An avid reader of fiction my whole life, I have always expected to have to suffer compromise in detail, accuracy and completeness when translating the written story to the screen. This series, however, brings the novels to the viewer with an unprecedented (to my knowledge) accuracy, completeness and precision. The most telling indicator of this is that each scene actually looks familiar on first sight, as it is so true to the reader's imaginings (mine, anyway) from the descriptive passages in Martin's books.

A special treat for both viewers and readers is the concept of a more realistic story-world, where the good guys seldom win and the finest characterisations are most often those of the darker, more evil souls in the saga. When the 'good guys' do secure some measure of victory then, it is all the more satisfying, as outcomes can almost never be reliably predicted.

The entire saga is so full of plot twists, surprise events and unexpected character development that I never found a single episode to be less than completely engaging; even enthralling. No doubt this is due in large measure to George R. R. Martin's involvement in the entire production.

Regardless of whether you are usually a fan of whatever genre you perceive this to fit into, if you appreciate absolute quality in television production, YOU MUST WATCH THIS SHOW!"
1016,"Actually I would give it 7.5 out of 10 if I could. It - to me was a bit like Sons of Anarchy in that it took a while to get in to and work out what is really happening. There are times when verbose confusing conversation dullens the sensual-ness of the awe inspiring scenery and sexy beyond words boys and girls. To clarify a point I have read in past reviews that this is set in a medieval time. No nothing can be further from the truth. Medieval times were a set period in human history from the 5th to the 15th century. I don't recall ever when they specify the time or date in GoT, this is not human history it is fantasy that is 'Reminiscent' of that time. The suggestion that there is too much Gratuitous sex is also to my mind incorrect. There is indeed a lot of Nudity and some sex but it isn't soft porn by any stretch of the imagination. The reason GoT sucks you in is that we develop personal likes and dislikes toward certain characters much like football teams and when a much loved character is murdered it seems almost unbelievable so of course your emotional side requires you to seek reprisal for the fallen by watching further until next thing you know the whole series is over. If it wasn't for the dull conversations about what King owns what land and did what to whom I would easily have given this 9.9 out of 10 but unfortunately that is not so."
1017,"The issue I have with ""Fill"" being used too much becomes very pronounced when viewing such a great story line which is this show. Hate to see too much dialogue used as a device to fill over content; see it in all shows. Don'y know why has to be relied on so much, but does allow new plots to happen. Thing is, the turns need to be believable... Stark girl could get out of bad situation and leave with The Hound, but stays. Same with ""Dwarf"" Lannister, why leave and have something better. Or, release of Jaime Lannister by Mum Stark....""Huh?""

Or, other Stark girl... could have ""three wishes Assassin"" kill bad king, etc. But no. Was even asked why, but conveniently, and unbelievably, dropped for new angle. But...everything but the obvious doesn't allow to shift thoughts. Needs to be explained, not explained away.

Even with shades of ""Token"", the added pain display and sex adds seasoning, but then becomes a mandate. Perhaps so the ""brain dead"" show viewers (with modern age mentality)will watch. But perhaps they will think in spite of themselves...hum, a function of keeping a show series going I suppose."
1018,"Season 1 Ep3 47'' 19': We all know about Dotrakies. They are savages with a strange language. But at this moment you can clearly hear the voice of some Dotaky People who are saying hello in Islamic way. I think this is harsh and intolerable to misuse art in purpose of offending other peoples. I just feel sorry for our world! That aside, the series is really fantastic one. Performances are so great and believable. I don't really like fantasy genre, but this time I follow the story eagerly. The personality of Ned Stark is impressive. He is always loyal to the throne. Another point of the series is great acting of children and teenagers."
1019,"Only after a long time i have watched a series which has the level of awesomeness that BREAKING BAD had. Well, i don't like mythological films/series that much but i do have to say after watching this i have to rethink. This is one of those series which will have a great impact on you. Only after much recommendation by my friends i went for this one. The casting, Direction, Acting, Screenplay and action scenes are just top level. The best thing is that you can't just leave it after watching one episode, it will surely hook you up. My personal favourite is TYRION LANNISTER , he is the next best thing to SHERLOCK played by BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH . Jon Snow is awesome as is Daenerys Targerean. This is one series which you will remember for a long time. ( Waiting eagerly for season 6 )."
1020,"When you have a story like this, where the author created his own world and let his imagination reach the limit, you need production that will be generous to the limit. HBO has made a masterpiece that took TV to a higher level. No matter who you are, you will enjoy this show. Fantasy, drama, suspense, action, war, romance... Heroes, villains and villains that become heroes... Angels that die and demons that linger on... this story just takes you everywhere. I was really amazed how they could include so many characters, each having a detailed history that is very well created. As I was amazed how the casting was so perfect.. None of the actors, no matter how small there role is, could be replaced. Peter Dinklage, Lena Heady, Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau, Sean Bean, Michelle Fairley... Kit Harrington, Iwan Rheon, Alfie Allen, Richard Madden... Maybe they have all been critically acclaimed, but I would like to praise the brilliant performance of Stephan Dillane, I would literally watch his scenes twice. The whole series is super, but ""Battle of the bastards"" I think is the best television production in history. The only thing I would criticize is the overdose of nudity and sex that wasn't at all needed, I believe that 90 percent of the nudity could've been avoided. Totally this is a MUST WATCH show. Can't wait for the 7th and 8th seasons."
1021,"I can't beleive how much the writing and dialogue has declined over the last few seasons. The banter is comically bad-similar to network tv. Disappointing since the show from every aspect, characters, story line and dialogue, was probably the best show ever. Terrible."
1022,"I mean the show speaks for it self, definitely best show in history period."
1023,"Game of thrones isn't just a TV series that's taken the world by storm since it's inception but, it's an emotion. Thrones has set benchmarks in cinematography, stellar performances, marvellous background scores and a scintillating storyline which would be very hard to match in times to come. As thrones nears it's end with the final season coming up in a few days, the feelings are mixed. On one hand all GOT fans are curious to know who will win the great war between the living and the dead and on the other hand fans will see their favourite characters one last time. Though every actor in Thrones is an institution in oneself, and it's hard to pick one but it's The character of Cersei Lannister that I absolutely loath. I despise it so much that I'm actually in love with Lena Headey whose absolutely nailed it with her performance and it's a pity she hasn't won an Emmy for this. If you truly despise a character so much it shows how good the actor is and Lena perfectly sums up that. A man is eagerly waiting for GOT one last time."
1024,First time i had seen such an interesting series....all the season are good but season 7 is best of it
1025,"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."
1026,"There isn't and will never be somethinh like GOT! This show really takes you places and makes you experience some interesting emotions. From hating to loving some characters or losing some of your favourites. It reveals the real world, politics, love, hate, sacred, sacrifice. The struggle of getting the power for whatever reason and so on..."
1027,"I love how these very few reviewers?, snobs? contrarians?, all these folks want to impress, I guess, all the rest of us poor idiot, no taste, suckers, who happen to judge this might be the best T.V. Gig since Sopranos or The Wire maybe. How can all the millions be just so bloody misguided? Maybe those other guys are just having a bad year or 4. But, it's a wonder I can even feed myself, I just watched ""The Door"" for the third full time getting ready for #8. I can't believe I keep going back to S.1, E.1 and get hooked in again to look for some more clues. Ah well, I have fun explaining them to my 4-legged son. At least he stays entertained with me. (Or maybe he's got me fooled, too!) Shoot, with S.8 we gotta go back to the once a week torture. I'll try to stay busy. You guys that think my brain must be mush for likin' this stuff, don't worry too much about me. Been thinking of checking in on Walter and that puss Pinkman again. P.S.- GoT truly is the best HBO, Showtime, etc series ever. (Even Curb Your Enthusiasm!)"
1028,"Great storytelling, good acting, great plot, great effects, and almost always consistent in quality. The only seasons that weren't quite as consistent as the others were 5 and 7. But 5 has some redeeming qualities (Hardhome). 7 has good episodes but it seems like the show runners wanted to end the show quickly so it feels very rushed, the quality is as good as the other seasons but the pacing was terrible."
1029,This is the best show on earth right now. The most complex and most thrilling action i've ever seen. MUST WATCH !!
1030,"Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this."
1031,"Very goooooooooooooooood, very beatufiel, wonderfull serie"
1032,Game of Thrones is a truly memorable and amazing fantasy epic the story complex and thought provoking the battles bloody and hard fought that does not shy away from graphic violence the lore gets more intriguing with each book and episode released even if your not one for fantasy this show will have something you will love I recommend giving this show a watch it's world will not disappoint the actors truly bring this world of fantasy alive every actor is that there very best here even the extras give it 100% No amateur hour acting to be seen anywhere there's also graphic Nudity and sex scene's which are done professionally and only adds to shows commitment to give you a genuine experience of this epic fantasy world.
1033,One of the best shows ever is going to end soon. Season 8 is coming and the question is who will finally sit on the iron throne... HBO made a very good trailer with no spoilers but left us with many questions.
1034,"Perhaps there has never been or will be again such a magnificent, absolutely enthralling story of adventure beyond imagination. I have watched all episodes over again, read the books, and listened to all the audio tapes. the Dragons are magnification, as is the Mother of Dragons, Daenerys Targaryen. I've waited too long this season. We are being built to the ultimate conclusion, then what?"
1035,Love the dynamic of the show and the dramatic twists getting so intense from season 6
1036,"If I were to present some form of video as representation of what kind of potential this medium has, it would be Game of Thrones. The writing is fantastic and poetic. The characters and casting are fantastic as well. Even if they were to adopt the cocoanut clacking of Monty Python's Holy Grail for its coming final season, it would still merit a solid 9! But in all seriousness, the entire series from start to finish is simply amazing.

It really does represent the pinnacle of the medium as a whole, and shows what can be possible when content meets substance. If only more series/movies took this approach... We might not see such a fading of its artistic applications."
1037,"A spectacular series that has provided some of the most gripping and awe inspiring tv of recent years. Great performances all round. As a viewer you feel at times that you have been a surrogate member of the Stark family as you move from one season to the next. 4 or 5 different but linked stories in one - each as enthralling as the next, though Jon Snows adventures at the Wall are the heart of it all. Kit Harrington is excellent in that role. Peter Dinklage brings Tyrion to life in spectacular fashion and Emilia Clarke is stunning as Daenerys. It feels as if their characters were written for them. How good too are Maisie Williams as Arya; John Bradley as Sam; Lena Headey as Cersei and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime? You could literally go through the whole central cast without finding fault. Dianna Rigg and Charles Dance perhaps two more to highlight. This could all have easily been a let down from Martin's original books but the tv production has even surpassed those. Bring on the final season. Just not sure what will rival this when its all over!"
1038,I cannot emphasise enough how much I love this show. It's amazing and unlike any other.
1039,"I have just one advice: watch it, and afterwards re- re- re- watch it (you will find new things every single time)"
1040,"Best tv serie of the times, i just simply love this. the characters are amazing specially daenearys and the starks"
1041,"I really love the show, I have been watched this 5-6 time all of season's episodes, really like it."
1042,"Just watch it already dammit, or ull have lived a worthless life"
1043,For many years to come and after the end of Game Of Thrones the industry is going to struggle to find content that might live up to GOT but it will fail! Yes Game Of Thrones is THAT good!
1044,I wish there is 100 star for Rating. Thank you Gorge R.R. Martine
1045,I have seen so of series but like GOT i have never seen it is the Best
1046,Unfortunately It's over but it will always be unforgettable
1047,"So to be without spoilers, and also because i'm too stoned at the moment, this won't be too detailed. GOT is fully thrown one of the best tv series you will watch in your life. Phenomenal acting, awesome character storyline's, and thrilling scenes that keep you on edge and waiting for the next episode. 10/10 would recommend, and a 10 is something i really refrain from giving anything, so that a 10 like GOT can be recognised when i rate it a 10. Watch it past the long first 2 episodes, and you will have 7 seasons so far of the best show of your life, from me."
1048,"Think this tv show and LORD OF THE RINGS movies might finally get hollywood to realize you dont need to reinvent the wheel. If you buy the rights to a famous fantasy book you should not change it you should aim to make as close a copy of that book in the medium of TV or movie.

This show gives me hope for the future of fantasy tv shows"
1049,"Just love it! Game of thrones got (! ;-)) it all! Really excited to see the last season. And I finally got my husband to see it as well. He hasn't been to keen, so I had to work a bit to make him see it. Now we see all episodes from the beginning, so we have fresh memories before the final season comes! 😍"
1050,"It has a great plot, the story is really good and all the secrets that some of the characters known are really shocking, it's one of my favorite series"
1051,"This show isn't perfect but it's as close to perfection as a TV show can be, the characters are believable and the actors fantastic. If you aren't onboard yet you are seriously missing out on how amazing TV can be, surely to be remembered as the greatest TV show of all time."
1052,I never read the books but I've enjoyed watching Game of thrones from the very first second of the first episode till the last second of the episode and I can't wait for the season finale!!
1053,"Everyting is perfect, the cast, the story, the background, the music"
1054,Hands down the best TV series ever made! Nothing even comes close!
1055,If you can spare 80 hours watching and you like suspense and thrill. This is for you and you will not regret a minute of it
1056,"My title says it all. Favorite show ever. Show stays true to the books, who are even more awesome."
1057,"Finally, a fantasy series comes out of the obscure and into the mainstream. This is hands down one of the best produced shows on the air.

It doesn't quite follow the books, as the many storylines and characters add a complexity that the average tv viewer would have trouble keeping up with; however, it does a great job with set dressing, costumes, and the actors are on point."
1058,"Currently the world's best and greatest TV series, don't mind there will be such a better series of TV in nearly one decade, its action, story, places where have been filmed, crew & cast all have been so phenomenal, I really love watching its every single episode repeatedly . The GAMEOFTHRONES director and its all casts ought to be praised highly for their talents and works but specially its director!"
1059,"A very expansive character favouring story tale of the old world, enjoyed every season"
1060,"This show really showed me how you build up characters, how to create a convincing plot and story and how to utilise upcoming actors to their fullest extent.

The biggest positive may be a recurring comment on all reviews of this show but that is the way they build up characters. You never can tell if a character is going to make it to the end of the show or is going to die the next episode which is the beauty of it. Every character has their own little segment of the episode dedicated to their character which is something that I can truly adore. Each character is meticulously developed each season and despite their being some characters that you would immediately dislike, you do get moments with the exact same character where you totally sympathise with in one scene which is truly admirable.

The acting is some of the most convincing I've ever seen in a TV show even though they shouldn't as it's a fantasy show but every episode can be taken seriously with emotion and pure grit.

The score in every scene is absolutely gorgeous and wows me every time alone."
1061,"A world filled with medieval fantasy and historic pretense, Game of Thrones is a lust filled, war-driven, Lord of the Rings-esque epic. It follows the standards that accompany the fantasy genre, such as knights, kings and queens, and the presence of dragons. Cersei Lannister, one of the main characters, is known for saying, ""when you play the game of thrones, you win, or you die."" As politics seem to be getting more and more violent, Cersei Lannister seems to nod towards our violent politics and policies set in place by governments around the world. Putting a new twist on the genre, George RR Martin manages to take modern problems, such as political corruptness, and incorporate it as the main plot line of the whole show. Following 3 main plot lines, you watch as the characters battle for the title of King of the Iron Throne, the Night's Watch protects Castle Black and the rest of Westeros, and an estranged princess across the sea slowly builds an army from nothing. Game of Thrones is a show that exceeds my expectations of what fantasy should be. While it has its fair share of epic battles, knights, and far off lands, it delves so much deeper into the main characters of the show; you feel like you know each character personally, and have struggled along with them. I give Game of Thrones a A+; it combines all the aspects of a typical fantasy, with a new twist. It is a must see for those interested in this genre."
1062,"One of the best things that happened to my life was game of thrones. Truly never before i watched any TV series. And when i started watching it in june,2017, i couldn't just stop watching this. Finished 6 seasons just in 5 days. That explains the quality of this series. GOT is the only thing which made me interested in TV series. I wish i had seen this show earlier."
1063,"With the root the most extraordinary story written in the last half century, Game of Thrones can now be considered a single event in television history, and one of the most epic unique moments of popular culture. With a unique production and performances mostly superb, HBO has managed to create something that goes beyond all barriers of television media. Characters without Manichaeism in a world without heroes incontestable. A complex and fascinating universe filled by intricate political intrigue. A real lesson of geopolitics, military science and political science. Apart from all the credits due to the mind of George R. R. Martin, we can never forget the brilliant work of creators that, every year, in a space of six months, can produce ten episodes of such high production."
1064,"Loving this new twist of old Norse stories adapted to the medievel era. Some characters are though much more boring than than the Norse characters, for example Cersei and Jamie. Sigmund and Sigi, the incestuous twins that have a child(Sinfjotli) that murders the king and his children. After this leaves his mother queen and sinfjotli eventually is poisoned. This is one of many examples on exactly who the characters in the series are based, not to mention that the entire story is Ragnarok. White walkers, dragons and a very well placed Loki in the form of petre baelish . If Baelish didn't exist stark never goes to kings landing,john Aryan lives, cersei and kids die along with daenarys and etc. One of the funnest aspects of the whole series is the way it hints as to what will happen next. For example the irony of tyrion telling oberyn you could at least wear a helmet or theon saying he will look like a eunuch. Although i enjoy the series the books are well worth the read as the series does edit much of what it considers filler out. I enjoy the banter of the characters in the books more than i do in the series and of course my favorite parts are almost never put in the show. While the last season strayed further away from the books I'm happy to see it go in that direction and leave more surprises for us fans. Unfortunately its Norse roots makes it a story I've read before with more profanity."
1065,"This is one of the shows that starts slowly, since it has a very broad story, to later on become a very epic show. There is nudity in the show, there are also a lot of vices but I am okay with it. if you don't like such things just stay away from this show. I would not recommend such a thing because that is not the focal point of this show and its positives far out ways the negatives to you, moreover from what I have gathered from reading the reviews on this site is that such things are original of what is in the books so there you go. I do not normally rate shows that high but this one is worth it and have earned it. The story is unpredictable, the acting is top notch and overwhelming. if you are now about to watch from season one I would ask you to give it time to develop and you would be rewarded later."
1066,"Game of Thrones is one of those shows that I avoided watching for a long time because usually I find that when everyone is telling me to watch a show and that it is awesome, and there is so much hype building up around it, I am pretty much always disappointed when I actually watch the show and don't end up liking it. But I was totally wrong to assume that would happen here!

Game of Thrones is an excellent show. If I had to nitpick I would say that maybe sometimes they race too quickly through story lines when I would like to see a bit more of what is going on. It can be hard to keep up with all the stories and characters but what there is here is amazing, really amazing.

I just find it harder to follow than most people because I guess I'm one of the few people who has not read the books. I can't wait to see more of this show!"
1067,"Enjoyable and mostly faithful version of the books with some plot changes but the characters certainly in character and looks standing up to the books except that Tyrion is more repulsive physically in the books with each eye of a different color and a waddle lacking in the film. He is the kindest of the Lannisters in both media and a clever strategist.

The archery, approaching ships with drums and wildfire at the Battle of Blackwater, the undead walking past Samwell Tarly are excellently done. Characters such as the Clegane's are well realized whilst Charles Dance is perfect as Tywin Lannister. Cersei, Joffrey, Arya and Sansa are spot on.

Winterfell is not well served in the film. It looks a very small place with a handful of filthy townsfolk muttering in a tiny courtyard and reminding one of Blackadder. The soldiers might be out and about but what has happened to the populace? This is not the mighty stronghold of Eddard Stark. Compare King's Landing's treatment - a citadel of comparable might.

Those like the books will find the film's portrayals of the characters appearing in their mind's eye; not a bad tribute to a film!"
1068,To all who have doubts of this show is missing a lot; i've seen the first season and finishing the second season but I am wanting more.A story that compelling leaves you with wanting to know what will happen next. known as an nominee for an all round spectacular show it shows kings for power but power is earned not taken. For those who take power it does not mean it is received but unfortunately it is given. But this element gives the edge that the show needs to be moving steadily as the most popular show on TV today. The climax is effective from episode to episode; personally I would like joffrey head on a spike. I am sure it won't cause usually he is well protected. For those who are looking for constant fight scenes and fruity ending it is not. It explores the human side and that is what I crave. Transitionally the story works with how it goes from almost every character especially Joffrey well played. Others that got me going was the first season finale I mean you cannot argue with that. Each episode has a sexual element and that also gives more true to the story of the gender role of the male and female in society. Overall I will continue watching and season three is not to far hopefully they come out with fireworks in such a confusing period time power and absolution.
1069,"this is the most amazing TV series i have ever seen in my life. its greatly written and well directed. thanks to george martin who is so good in taking us to the world of fantasy land. the characters in this show is so rich and each one has its own story. right from 8000 yrs ago in westeores before the wall to aegons landing and after 300 yrs later how Robert rebellion broke out and 17 yrs later how game of thrones events happen and the king rode to north to ask for his best friends help to look after his kingdom. most of the TV shows are very slow in stories but this one have good pace and twist in every episode.

i loved the way the george martin created all seven kingdoms, the major houses and minor ,their culture, their sigil,the family tree their appearances such as traits like their looks,hair, eyes and their words. and mainly wall of north and what lies beyond.also they have shown nice scenic landscapes and scenic beauty of the nature and did great job to show how westeroes look like. i m also very excited about the seasons the way it happens in westeroes and the winter with long night. it takes best directors and filmmakers to understand this book and transform it into great entertainment and truly they lived it upto the standards. also the music track is such overwhelming and deep. right from best opening sequence which takes to different part of westeroes and neighbor continent with moving veiw map representation with such powerful electrifying soundtrack.

when u see game of thrones u must have some of the knowledge about book song of ice and fire and should know about some past history and events then u will enjoy this shows a lot. this show is not just about blood, violence and swords. but about understanding each and every character and their importance.u will love each and every scene of the every episode and duologue's and conversation and will get drawn in each and every character.

i just culdnt hold myself to watch the next season of the game of thrones even though i read the book."
1070,"I consider myself as a man who doesn't watch TV series, i never did.On the other hand,i enjoy watching movies. Some friends of mine told me about game of thrones.They compared this series with lord of the rings and when they did that...that was the final hit.I started watching the 1st season, i watched it all,every episode.Someone could say that i was inspired or even more that i was amazed. No i wasn't, it was just the needing to know.I wanted to see what was going to happen.Maybe this is the goal of the producers, maybe they don't care if you like it, they just want you to watch,to watch it all.If that is, they achieved it. But let me tell you this, this has nothing to do with lord of the rings. You are not going to see lord of the rings in a TV series version.I am not saying if this is good or bad, this depends on each one's preferences.All i am saying is that this is something completely different. Here you can enjoy corruption,anti-heroism,back-stabs,murders,ultra- violence,naked ""sausages"" and bouncing ""melons"",if you know what i mean and most of all death.As for fantasy,battles,true heroes and...fantasy, this is not the right place to be.Of course i don't believe that fantasy and battles is all that lord of the rings gives.On the opposite,lord of the rings, mostly as a book but as a film too,transfers very deep meanings. I want to add,as an answer to some reviews, that true heroes and true villains are not childish or superficial.The existence of the good and the evil symbolizes the human and his internal fight and dilemma.Talking about lord of the rings,i think that its heroes are much more realistic than the ones in the game of thrones.Every important character in lord of the rings confronts his/her bad and dark self,for example frodo and boromir did.But the target is to transfer the meaning of hope and love that's why finally comes the redemption of the characters.I didn't see this in game of thrones and i didn't like it. Concluding,you could find some interesting things in game of thrones,one of them is the plot which will easily keep your eyes on the screen.Have a good day."
1071,"I really liked the 1-st season, it was great and it had everything. Season 2 was a bit of disappointment and in season 3 it keeps going like season 2.

The general feeling is there are too many plans of action, and actually if you summarize en episode not much happens. An episode has one hour, and you have in season 3 maybe 10-12 plans of action, this means 5 minutes per plan - well not much happens as there is no physical time and everything goes forward very slow and it is kind of boring.

And there are still new characters which appear in the movie. It is sad as this is ruining the movie. It is a good idea to have a complex movie with plans which intersects at certain point and have a connection, BUT you should keep it more simple, as from an action point of view I don't feel the dynamic of the movie, everything became static. I kind of lost the desire to see the movie. I thought is only my problem but I spoke with friends who are watching but they said the last 2 seasons are pretty boring, but they couldn't really say why.

I gave a 9 as a mark for first season, but I can't go higher than 7 for the next two seasons. I only look now because I got used with the characters.

I also feel a central character is missing from the movie. In the first season I felt Ned Stark was closer to something like this. but maybe this is the idea, not to have one.

Anyway, I hope my review will reach the right eyes and maybe they fix season 4(maybe kill some characters). There shouldn't be more the 6-7 plans in a movie, at least 10 minutes per action should be shown in one episode."
1072,"The complexity of the plot and characters makes this show an awesome must-see television. Standing ovation is given to HBO! You could call this sci-fi, war, medieval, drama because it encompasses all. After the first season, you simply cannot resist but to watch all the rest of the shows already produced and aired. Now I cannot wait until the final two seasons come out!!"
1073,"Dont waste your time. I mean, its simple blood, gore, killing, dragons, monsters, giant men and sex.

Nothing special about it."
1074,The literary basis was given to the authors as the big field for making famous for disgusting things. All characters are the crowd of slaves their fears.
1075,"Why do you all expect this to be a full blown movie filled with plot, fights and everything? This is a SEASON PREMIERE. Have you ever seen a show where all the awesome action already happened in the first episode? Thks is still a TV show. I hoped for them to bring everything together and wrap up all unasnwered questions, and they did. And: they did it even better than I had hoped.

And to those who complain about this not being a feature length episode: Have you been living under a rock? The lengths of the episodes have been out for weeks. If you dont expect every episode to be a Winds of Winter, you will also have a lot more fun watching it.

Ps: The jokes worked really well and they also did for almost everyone who was in the theatre with me."
1076,The best movie I've ever seen and enjoyed is waiting to watch the final version. Thanks and appreciation for all the factors that make up and cast this film ..
1077,"Best Tv series of all time!!! GOT even surpass all the movie that were said to be best movies of all time such as Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and Titanic. and surpass even the most hype movie nowadays Avengers. This is definitely a must watch Tv series!!!!"
1078,"I've watched many TV shows in my life, but this one is one of the most awesome TV Show i've ever watched. For some of you, you'll find it boring in the beginning but stick with it, you won't regret it. #ForTheThrone"
1079,Seriously IMDb?! Wanna review... You must remove the review section for this show and give it golden ten stars because simply no one can say a negative word about it... sorry about my interaction but I'm obsessed.
1080,Game of thrones is the most amazing series I've ever seen
1081,"My favorite characters,sound track and favorite webseries also"
1082,"From the opening scene followed by the amazing ""Game of Thrones"" tune, you know you're in for something very special. Game of thrones shows off his high budget and really immediately draws you into its beautiful created fantasy world. From the start they show they mean business and you soon realize that you have never seen a tv show like this. Its beautiful landscapes, cities and the amazing diverse set of characters is mindblowing. From the beginning you get to know these great characters and you get to get really involved in them, whether you love a certain character or you absolutely dispise a certain character, game of thrones does it really well and it feels like you get to know these characters really well over the course of the current 7 seasons. All i can say is.... Fasten your seatbelts, enjoy the ride, get ready to be amazed, get ready to be shocked, you will cry, you will be in awe, this show has it all. An absolute masterpiece that will leave all tv shows behind itself and makes you wish for more as soon as you have watched the last episode. Warning: this show does contain shocking scenes that might not be for everyone.

FINAL VERDICT: This is isn't just a tv show its an experience not to be missed, a must watch for anyone who loves a great story, great characters and doesn't mind the occasional shock value!! Oh and did i mention..... It has dragons!!!! Enjoy everyone😉👍"
1083,I loved each and every season and each and every episode of #GOT. My favorite character is Tyrion the imp. iam waiting for the final Its totally amazing
1084,Okay so I never thought I would like this show. I always heard stuff about it and I would be like it cant be that good get away from me nerd but during my break I had no thing to watch so I was like why not. So I watched it andddddd OMG its so freakin GOOD like I never thought I would be a game of thrones fan but here I am reading 300 something pieces of trivia on IMDB like it's keeps you hooked from the first episode which is really hard to do. It's sooo good.you need to give it a try don't judge it by stuff you heard cause it so much better than that. You guys seriously need to watch it. Give it a chance cause it will shake you to the core
1085,"Never seeing what it's happening next.The setting is unprecedented,and the vision is marvelous.Eight years,waiting for the end season."
1086,"This is the best film I´ve ever seen, because it is a very interesting film and it always makes you to be very attentive and to be very concentated in the film to don´t loose a single detail. Also they have used many different shots and scenes, with many famous actors and actresses; they have do a lot of effort and also they spend a lot of time doing it."
1087,"I love GOT, I can't believe it's going to end. I'm going to miss this series."
1088,"Game of thrones, this show is just amazing in every possible way. Every episode is great, I enjoyed all of them and I can't wait to see the end of this story. I really love the show and the characters are amazing the good ones and the bad ones. Just mind blowing."
1089,I have Seen breaking bad and I have seen GOT no doubt why they are so highly rated.
1090,"I love this TV series more than Prison Break and The Walking Dead. Actually, it's the best!"
1091,From the beginning i was hooked you got everything you need here to have the perfect show shows like this come once in a life time
1092,Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1093,"This series could easily be considered a masterpiece as far as TV shows are concerned. There was a fair share of lackluster performing from certain members of the cast insofar as the delivery of certain lines was concerned, but all in all it's great. Other than changing how certain lines were delivered/the inflection of voice with which certain lines were delivered, there isn't much else to gripe about. This series is worth the hours of your life you lose watching it."
1094,"First of all - if you're hesitant to whether or not you should see it, I'm telling you to watch it, but you gotta give it at least 3-4 episodes before you're in. There is a lot of different character ans stories going on so you have to give it a chance. I my self got stuck after the first episode, probably because I'm an actor myself and can tell when a story is good. (does that even make sense?)

Anyway, this is one of my favorite shows ever. I've always liked this time period, and I got stuck after watching the first episode, and I've been ever since. It's rare to find shows that are as well made as films since they're under a lot of time and money pressure. This is for anyone who wants a lot of great visual effect, action, and cat-and-mouse game and brilliant storytelling. Words to describe this show: bloddy violence, intrigue, epic, evil, sward fight,

I give it 10 out of 10"
1095,"That ""Game of Thrones"" is one of the best show which has ever been produced for TV, can't barely be denied, even if there are also many people who cannot really understand that opinion. It seems to be a matter of taste. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the incredible brutality which takes place regularly on screen, sometimes seems to be a little bit exaggerated. Of course it makes the show even more thrilling and fascinating. But I would say, you can also make a good TV-show without that amount of blood. There are enough others which proved that. I think the reason for the producers to use so much blood, is that they wanted to separate from other medieval fantasy shows. And they succeeded.

But nonetheless, despite of the maybe appropriated critique, the show still is most likely one of the best ones I've ever seen. Of course, the show is definitely nothing for the faint-hearted people, but for all the others it is clearly worth to watch it, if you haven't done that so far.

I hope there are not too many mistakes in my text. If there are, I'm sorry, but I'm no native speaker."
1096,"I'm sure this is one of the best TV Series ever! Every thing is good and even close to the perfection, but the thing is that it is not even close to the original books! I'm just finished the first part of the book three an I love it! Although I rate this TV Series 9/10 (I think it is even deserve 10/10) but unfortunately it is not good as the books! I think if this Serial was made more like the original book, it could have became even much better! These casts and this story, have more potential than this and I believe they can do even greater than this! I like this TV Series but in compare to the George R.R. Martin's books it is nothing! As I said I gave 9/10 ( even 10/10) to this TV Series but when I compare it with the book,it is 4/10!! I really suggest to anyone whom can read the book, to read it! It is really something different! It's really magnificent!"
1097,Amazing I love Jon Snow The best of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1098,It just is mate. So many moments of absolute madness that has never before been seen on TV.
1099,"Literally binged watched this, absolutely loved it!"
1100,"There haven't been many TV series that had me hooked, but GoT is definitely one of them. High production values, great cast and acting, and an enticing story.

I haven't read the books, so this point of view is coming from someone without a grudge on book to movie differences :)"
1101,"Guys just one thing to tell you, watch it... thats all I want to tell you... It will hook you up!"
1102,"I am not a big fan of TV shows but this is the only show I watched from the beginning to the latest episode till date.People will always love a TV show or a movie with a good story narration and a story with emotional connect.Only then the audience feel connected to the story and it stays with them for years.And this does all that.

The best thing about Game of thrones is it's very huge and the most interesting characters that you come across in the show.The intellectual Tyrion Lannister, the diplomatic Petyr Baelish & Lord Varys, the ruthless Cersei Lannister, the responsible & duty bound Jon Snow and many other characters which sink deep into the audience's hearts is what makes the show more lovable.

Once you start watching an episode you will get involved into the story so much and each and every episode will be very intriguing.If there are any who hasn't watched this show yet and not much of a fan of TV shows I strongly recommend this show Game of Thrones because no TV show or movie even comes closer to this because my friend ""Winter is Coming""."
1103,"Starting decades ago when the first book was released, George RR Martin's story about Westeros has been part of my life. I expected the series to be wishy washy because of all the (possibly) objectionable or offensive parts, but it was incredibly well done. I simply love the books, HBO series, actors, and over-all production. I can't wait until next year, but then it will be over. I might have to read/watch all over again..."
1104,"Well, i really enjoyed the first 4 seasons. Some interesting characters and also character development within credible plots and some twists. At first I didn't like Game of Thrones and needed a second attempt to watch it. Once I get into the world of GoT i really like how the story was told and only a few faults I noticed. With the start of season 5 and continuation in season 6 the show lost me, just a few good scenes and developments. I didn't read the books, just started the first one. And I think the TV show writers did a good job on the original material by GRRM. Well, till they come to season 5 and 6. In season 6 they speed up some story lines and I don't really care about most characters, how can I if I see them only a few moments in a season? Now the characters don't develop (no time for that) anymore, they just have to operate. And the writing lost it's subtle brilliance, but we get a better production value instead. I don't want to spoil and go into details, but there a some plot developments and character actions which are just poorly written, but it looks great. Obvious the makers switched focus, for me the show lost it's high value and there are better shows to watch but as I can see among my friends and reactions on the internet most people agree with the show and where it is going. For me just the bran plot line could be interesting in the future and also the white walker part and the rest seems to be predictable. In the sixth season I started reading fan theories and reviews and found more interesting plot developments among the fans than the actual TV writers. To give it a rating: 8 of 10 because of the first 4 Seasons, for season 5 and 6 I would give a 6 and 7 (of 10)."
1105,"This is a good show that potentially could be better, however what so many TV shows seems to lack is new faces. I suggest, from having watched most of his movies that you bring one of the CSI supporting cast Tino Struckmann with you on this new endeavor and give him a bigger part. we need new faces just like his. he can act and does not look like all the other boring actors and he have chops. I know most series casting or execs do not read reviews but as a fan and somebody in the industry I wanted to open the door for new talent deserving of your attention. A veteran who does his own stunts, knows hos to hold a gun, he started on E-ring and lead a bunch of Indie movies but it is time he gets a break. He became known for his book on women's safety and have his heart in the right place. He in originally European and know how to swing a sword."
1106,I heard a lot of people say this was good. I put of watching it for months and wish i never. It is the best series i have ever watched ever i love it. It takes a while to remember all the names of people and to remember who they are working for. Do not watch it if you do not like blood and violence because there is a lot and don't watch if easily offended as there is a lot of sexual content in every episode nearly. I must say it has a excellent story line and keeps you wanting more and more every episode. Some characters you grow to love and some you really hate them and i mean hate But that comes from the superb acting. Game of thrones is fantastic.
1107,"This TV Series is undoubtedly the Greats TV Series of all time!! and it is no wonder that after 5 years, it is still considered the best TV Series and Top rated . The Movie has a Great and Deeply Created Story , the Characters are PERFECTLY Picked and the Movie is almost Completely Without any Flaw . Perfect Characters, Perfect Story , Perfect Pace , and So full of contents that they literally Trim so many parts of the Story to be able to put each series in 10 episodes, Most definitely the Best between all the TV Series and movies, in Music , in Graphical Scenery , and in pathology of each character . the Movie is based on a very strong story which can support more than 50 episodes in a single Season . and just as its name suggests, it is the Crown Jewel of all the TV Series in History of Cinema ! Definitely rated 10 (100/100 , any fewer rate would be a real Injustice to the Greatest Movie of all time, which it is) in my list of Ten best TV Series of all time, the Game of Thrones as expected Sits on the Top of it all, The List is as Follows: 1.

if you haven't started these TV Shows yet, then you should start RIGHT NOW, otherwise you would lose your would've been Greatest Moments of your life ."
1108,"Overall show is awesome, on par with Breaking Bad, but the problem (personally with me) is only nudity in it. Well to gain the market, nudity in start makes sense, but please, I would like to say this (to authors, if any is reading my review) that lessen the nudity. It will not affect the rating now..... I rated it 9, I would have rated 10 if it was clean. Or, please at least provide ""Censored"" version of all of it as early as possible, that might be helpful... The storyline given by George R. R. Martin is little bit different from what the writers of shows have made it to Whoever has liked this show, should must watch Breaking Bad, its on par with this show, or you can say it vice versa too... Thanks"
1109,"I never thought that one day i would rate a US TV series with ""epic"".

Peter Jackson is one of my personal ""heroes"", because he gave us The Lord of the Rings (film series)and the hobbit. OK, you see - i love fantasy.

Then came Game of Thrones and i was flashed. This American fantasy drama television series is for me also one masterpiece of an epic fairy tale.

All i can say: Please, please more of such epic masterpiece films. I can say this is perhaps one of the best adaptation of a book into TV. Top. Thanks."
1110,This show is amazing it has an immense world that's ever growing. And it's unpredictable good watch most shows you can guess exactly where it's headed not this one. The story will draw you in to a world that you can't get enough of. I haven't read the books thou I'm tempted but I love to absorb the story through the show. You will get deeply involved with the characters and the world. I guess what my point is the series is one of the best things I've ever seen on TV I am truly addicted and am very excited for the next season. Gorge e.r Martin is a literary genius and HBO did a fantastic amazing job bring his work to life. My only complaint is I always want more.
1111,"it was a nice TV series for me. the last TV series i watched are knight rider and mcguyver and it was a very very very long time ago. the actors and actresses from this series are magnifecently great and im glad that the other actors and actresses are given a chance to show their talents and craft not like our celebrities here in the philippines, they used the same celebrity over and over again. their character will be dead on the next episode because they are doing another role in other TV series in the same studio. but i noticed some problem game of thrones, why the director or writer they frequently changed what is already happened in the books."
1112,"I started watching this at the recommendation of a friend. I have to say at first, I did not see what all the fuss was about. In the opening scene I thought- this is going to be good, only to follow the majority of Season One being consistently disappointed, bored , and hoping for it to get better. I only kept watching because,asides from rave reviews, and a fabulous cast, I did enjoy the stunning scenery, and actually recognized some of the non-CGI'd landscapes from my childhood, as some scenes were shot where I grew up. All the scenery, however, is amazing- and I find myself totally drawn into this fictional land as a result. I will say though that it took me the most of season 1, to get a feel for the show, and while it was really slow for me at coming together, the first season ended with everything that I was hoping for. I never read the books that led to this screenplay, but if the screen adaptation is anything to go by, I would imagine that it would be like one of these books that you have difficulty getting into, but once you do you absolutely can't put it down. I'm just beginning season 2 , and am very glad I didn't give up on this show. Hat's off to the brilliant acting from the cast- even with the slowness of Season 1 , their amazing talent still shone through and were another reason I stuck with it."
1113,V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3.V3rY n1c3. V3rY n1c3.
1114,"There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said: It's a fantastic series.

I did not see this series for a few years - didn't have the means to do so. I finally bought the series on DVD to watch because I HAD to see this series. I knew I would love it - and others that have seen it kept reminding me of it and telling me I must watch it! I'm glad others prodded me about it and happy I bought it for viewing. I fell in-love as I knew I would. I will buy Season 8 when it comes out - I have to see the ending and complete the set.

If you still haven't seen this series and love medieval fantasy then I highly recommend this for viewing - I would prod you to watch as I was - you won't be disappointed!

10/10"
1115,Best TV show ever!!! It is not comparable with others...
1116,"There is a show which comes around every ten years which just takes my breath away and this is one of them. This show only casts the best actors, has the best cinematography and the best action scenes though it is not for kids. The only problem with this show is the last 3 seasons as it focuses on the more boring characters but i guess it has to do that for character development. In summary this is one of the greatest shows ever made just don't watch it if you are under 18 or with a parent."
1117,"The series is now on the 6th season. This is the first time the readers are at a loss at what will happen next as the book series ended at about the same point as the HBO 5th season left everyone. This is the first time that HBO is coming up with all of their material as original work with some help from George R.R. Martin, himself. So this is the really the first time we actually see the creators of the HBO show stand alone in creativity with nothing to really go off of... and they are doing an AMAZING job!

I think fans were skeptical at the split. Many figured that the successful books were part of the reason the show was so good, but this season is easily proving all of that wrong. The twists and turns so far are exhilarating and seem to kind of follow the fans' inspired theories. (No spoilers!)

The acting is still incredible and watching the series is like stepping into a whole other world. HBO did a great job in its casting and the scenery is always gorgeous. I am personally looking forward to everything having to do with Bran. But all of the characters and their own sets of drama are what keeps me watching religiously every Sunday at 8:00pm."
1118,"If you are a series lover, and want to see exciting series which is filled with a lot of drama, romance, ego, conspiracy and what not, this show is seriously meant for you guys. The show is based on the lives of the people who are fighting for the throne-and, one who will sit on the throne will be the ruler of The Seven Kingdoms. This show is a historical fiction with supernatural happenings like the white walkers (the dead walking ice man) who are ready to kill, and even the dragons. The show is filled with a lot of good dialogues and the casting actors have played their role very well. This show i.e. Game of Thrones is a must watch show and will leave a lasting mark on your memory.

Hence, I strongly recommend all the viewer to at least give it a try and sink in its beauty. You won't regret!!!!"
1119,"what can you say about this show, it has everything your looking for in a major television series. the story is fantastic and the characters even better. one thing that you will surely love about this show is that it is one of the few that stay true to the books it is based off of, i mean the books had to have been good for them to make a television show off of it, and they were right the books were good, and i think the writer knew that so they stayed true to the story that the fans already fell in love with, and that why i believe this TV show has had so much success and will in the future. this isn't like these other shows you see where the creators and producers of the show think that their ideas are top notch and change an already amazing story, no when HBO picked up this show they knew the potential, brilliance and overall great story telling."
1120,"Great, great show but number one show of all time remains Babylon 5!

That is all."
1121,"Firstly, you're better off watching the show and seeing for yourself than reading this review. However, if you still want to, you can go on. I really don't care if the show's storyline deviates from the books. What keeps me hooked to the show is the superb pace and detail that is associated with each of the parallel story lines. Each storyline is handled delicately and a viewer will seldom feel a bias towards a particular one. Every character exhibits true human character and is not just a vessel for reciting the script. For me, every character scores top marks in every department. Also, you can't forget the setting and the scenery. Their selection immensely affect the atmosphere of a scene giving it way more definition. The least that I can say about this show is that it is an intense work of art. To conclude, this show is just about perfect and I bet it will be the one to beat for quite some time down the line in its genre."
1122,"I'm just gonna say that Game of Thrones is my favourite series of all times. If you want action, fantasy, power games, sex, love and a lot, really a lot of fights and battles, you should watch Game of Thrones. Like, right now. I mean it.

Game of Thrones is the first series I've ever seen in my life, and it obviously have a very special meaning for me; but that's not the only reason because I love GoT. I love Daenerys, and Tyrion, and Arya and a lot of characters; but I hate a lot too. I think it's just axesome how in a sooo large cast of characters the viewer know (and hate or love) every single one of them. I love the way all the story lines crosses in one point and separate in the other, and I love the fact that we, all the fans, have fear as hell that one of our fave characters die in the next episode."
1123,"If one is really bored from Daily stuff and wanna try something new then he should really try this series.

one of the most successful TV series till date Game of thrones is must watch for every TV addict.This is the series that will never get you bored.all the actors in the series are fantails especially TYRION and JON. the one thing that will force you to see it is it's curios-able ending of every episode.Till date 5 season have aired so far and people are waiting die heartedly for next season. This series has changed the HBO channel reputation and users review towards television. a must watch for everyone."
1124,"Finally, this is the show anyone wants to see. When i watched the first three episodes of Game of Thrones, i got disoriented easily because of the extremely wide scope of the stories. But as we watch more and more, this thing becomes the reason why we all carried on watching the show.

Many folks out there said that this show isn't particularly similar to the books, and they said that the show is deviated from the books, but this is really why we should watch it. If the show goes on exactly the same as the books, then the book readers have no reasons to waste their time on watching the show.

Of course, our gratitude should go to the mastermind, George R.R. Martin, and the producers, Dave Benioff and Dan Weiss. They've made this show very interesting from episode to episode, and keep us watchers to be curious on whats gonna happen next."
1125,"Oh my (?) God, oh my (?) Devil, oh my ... somebody / something else ! It's like HBO kept preciously all the feelings, sensations we were expecting this season ... and found a way to amplify them and send them back to me in one hour ... As already written by another reviewer, this episode is the one that marked me the most since the beginning of GOT ... I certainly agree that not everyone felt like me, but i really did feel the adrenaline in my veins ...

HBO made us drive a roller coaster this season, and i have reached the top of it a few minutes ago ....

One can say many things about GOT. This kind of show isn't the type of shows i usually appreciate, but i can't deny GOT is the one and only show that's ""playing"" with my body and my soul of such a way."
1126,"Such a good TV Show, nearly as good as Breaking Bad. But it needs to tune down on the unnecessary sex and nudity! Sean Bean is such a good actor and I hate the fact that they killed him off but that's the thing with Game of Thrones, it's unpredictable so you never know what's going to happen. I love the fact that at the end of every episode something big happens and it keeps you guessing for the next episode and Breaking Bad did that but I think Game of Thrones does it better! Peter Dinklage is an awesome actor especially in this Show, series 4 is starting soon and I sure as hell hope they don't kill him because it would then get irritating, and killing off all the characters would get repetitive, the acting is very good, however for some actors, it's not the best. But if they kill of Peter Dinklage, I will stop watching."
1127,"The series Game of Thrones is a very entertaining précis of the enormously thick books! The production values are very high and it all has a gritty and real feel to it. Extremely well done and I hope they are able to adapt the whole saga. Trouble is, whenever something good comes along it always seems to be the first thing to be cancelled!

However, after reading the books I thought - I've read this story before - often word for word. I am not sure if I am remembering correctly but Robin Hobbs 'Assassin' series springs to mind. Anyway, whichever series it was all I recall of that other story is that it was tedious and repetitious - at least George Martin made it more interesting!!"
1128,"Glad to see the back of this appallingly over acted, dreadfully scripted, over hyped tripe. It should not have lasted pass season 1 - it survived based upon hype only and the masses lapped up this chewing gum for the eyes. Having sat through several episodes at the request of those who bought into the hype, it just shows how low the bar has been set for literary works - it's been rinsed for every dollar it could take out of the hands of those who follow it like a cult. Dreadful, but at least it about to die and be confined to the history books of television, unlike the rotting corpse of the Walking Dead that even Andrew Lincoln could not run fast enough away from - they really are about to inflict yet another full season of absolute garbage on the public with such unrealistic story lines it's farcical. If you enjoy such shallow trash as escapism from life good luck to you and I hope it lives up to everything you want it to be and more."
1129,"Hello, I have a good question.

After watching all the seasons of game of throne, I feel that the show, an epic TV series, would spoil a lot of plot and setting in order for me to read the book now. I actually enjoy watching the game of throne since I just watched all the season in 3 days, I felt that this was a great series so I imagine that the book would be epic. I am this type of person who does not care about criticizing other show if I do not like it, so I am looking forward toward your response especially from all this big fan of the book too. Does the show reveal everything that's in the book? Do you think it's worth to watch the show and read the book( a consideration for summer)?

Sincerely,

Mee"
1130,"Not going to lie, I started watching Game of Thrones last year. One of my very good friend compelled me to watch is and I will be grateful to her my entire life for making me to do so. I watched all seasons in a mere weekend. This show picks up its intensity episode by episode to a point where you start to really believe that you are part of this imaginary world. This enigmatic show is full of suspense and surprises making its story line impeccable. A must watch!!"
1131,"No doubt this is one of the best series ever made, partly because of the final quality of the production, but I really think the creators could have focused more on the plot and on don't taking 7 years to bring it to an end. Happy the one who will start to see when the last season is out."
1132,"I would like to know why this review was deleted? I was not shocked when I learned that they are going to shoot Game of Thrones in Dubrovnik. But for Dubrovnik to be the King*s Landing a.k.a London, that was unfair. For London of course! Dubrovnik is such a backwater and a province! It is very beautiful, and interesting for film shooting since they repaired it, since it was largely destroyed by the Serbs and Montengrins in 1991. But it is a small town with a provincial feel. What in the Earth did I do there for 10 years???!!!??? Well at least kids grew up, but I will never forgive what they did to my children especially Theodore in Ivana Gundulića school. Why were they aggressive towards them? Because they were American born? Svata!!! Dubrovnikians sometimes felt like the Orks. Very aggressive and nationalistic. Albeit Dubrovnik is beautiful like a gem! The whole Dubrovnik-Neretva county is like a gem. I hope the scouting people of the Game of Thrones will find Popovići beach and do couple of shots there. I even tried to be an extra in the series by they did not pick me. They did pick my neighbour and he was given 50euros for three days of shooting.

As far as the series goes, I had a feeling that I watched something similar in like Lord of the Rings films. It is unavoidable that someone was going to spread those films into series. It is fun to watch, for we will have some more seasons. But I think I outgrew it, it is for the kids. All the actors are so good but Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage carry the whole series. Special effects are great, the naval siege of the King*s Landing is fantastic and Dubrovnik walls became useful for the first time in its history, Dubrovnik was never sieged, except in its very early history, the walls you see today never were used to defend Dubrovnik, it was deemed to unimportant by both the Turks and the Venice.

I think that 9,4 grade is too high to mark the series, given on IMDb.com page. I gave it 7 out of 10. And please do not come to Dubrovnik to check out the locations. From your bodies we can not walk freely on Dubrovnik streets.

Above lines were written after watching three seasons. I wanted to add a little bit more after season four.

I have to say it was more interesting to watch season four, it became more serious and everything jumped for a notch, acting, plot, visual and special effects. I especially enjoy acting by Emilia Clarke. Man she really portrays deep savagery of her character, I have a need to do her in a local WC on Lokrum island, if you get my drift...

I will raise my grade from 7 out of 10 to 8 out of 10. Just as I said, everything became better in season four. I have to say I am looking forward watching season five and beyond, I am interested which parts of Dubrovnik did they use for sets, although I do not like Dubrovnikians, I love Dubrovnik*s geography. It really is one of the rare gems of beauty in the world..."
1133,"This is the only TV show which I stopped watching after I watched an episode. This TV show clearly shows that how Americans are into sex thing. I mean you can write a lot of good things that are better than sex. Why do you want this in the show? It's so gross. (Especially when you're eating. I can't even imagine.) It's like watching a blue screen film. So, I stopped watching after an episode.

I just wish they didn't add those sex scenes into the show. If they didn't, I might give at least five stars."
1134,"It is an excellent Series. However I am disappointed from the beginning that other cultures and colours are ignored. Despite the globalization and UK being involved with different cultures thought out its history there is still selection and discrimination. We talk about gays and lesbians, women but none have the courage to use people of other cultures, colours in these neutral stories. Humans have evolved in Africa from a beggar to royalty and yet we find such barriers. I hope from now onwards over 50% of the cast belong to other civilization beyond UK. This is a sexually explicit series. It is raw and brutal at times but I have to commend the courage shown by the directors to portray this. This is perhaps how humans as animals behave in a world where power dominates. This is how tribes behave in isolated parts of the world. This is a universal law of nature before we became ""CIVILIZED"". Yet such behavior persists amongst animal kingdoms."
1135,This is a very good fantasy show. You should see this show. It is a great show. It has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is not a 9.5 that is kind of overrating it. But still a very good show. There are actors in this that were in Lord of the rings. This show is awesome. See it. It is a great show. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say. This a great show. Peter Dinklage is a great actor. Lena Heady is a great actress. David Benioff a great writer . I give this show 7 out 10. See this show it is very scary. Emilia Clarke is a great actress do not miss this show. Kit Harington is a great actress.
1136,We do not sow. We do not sow. We do not sow. We do not sow. We do not sow. We do not sow. We do not sow. We do not sow. We do not sow. We do Jon Snow.
1137,...........................................................................................
1138,This is the most exciting series I have ever seen There are no mistakes in it The story needs an audi prize
1139,"I love this show. Really.

But:

I read the books now and realized that the showrunners has had a hard time once they left the books. The difference in pacing and plot twists become noticeably worse. Nevertheless still great tv.

My only other critique is the prevalence of sexual violence. Although RR Martin's mind is even worse in regards to this in the books, the show could have treaded a little more carefully here.

All in all though: amazing tv, production and acting."
1140,It's not gust a series it's a revolution in the world of tv we should support it to have mor of this
1141,Love Hate Compassion Treason Yup . We felt them all
1142,"It's undoubtedly the greatest series of our time. It's going to be nearly impossible for any series to beat it, right from the awards scene to fans mobilization. Game of thrones takes it all. have read all the books and I started watching Game of Thrones the same day it was aired and it's no. 1 for alot of reasons. You can't easily bank on what to come, Character complexity, landscape, make up, VFX, Archetypes are presented, destroyed, and rebuilt, sorry telling, the politics and art, there is no better show with so much and details. It's the best there is!"
1143,"The best thing in this series is that you can't predict anything, yet you will enjoy every sigle minute of this amazing series."
1144,Best Serie good characters and a perfect plot And nice relationships 😝
1145,"Whatched many many series and movies, but GOT is with head and shoulders above all series the beste serie ever. If you dont like the fake things like dragons, even then you gonna love it"
1146,"Absolutely amazing show, one of the best, if not the best of all time. grand epic scope and very involving story with fascinating characters. also, A lot of very sexy women show their boobs. and dragons."
1147,"Game of Thrones challenges the viewers to watch and develop the taste to enjoy it for first 3-5 episodes. It is not because it is bad; it's just that most of us are used to watching shows and movies with linear story lines. You will truly enjoy it once you get the hang of the character names and their relation to one and another.

The production quality with attention to details is amazing, similar to Peter Jackson's LOTR. The dialogues, the acting especially by the child actors are commendable.

The CGI improves as the season progresses due to better budget and technology. The first four seasons I would say are the best till now(season 7) when you look at only through the perspective of political gamesmanship.

The show later on becomes more linear as story lines show signs of merging. Season 5 and 6 have beautifully shot action sequences laced with incredible background score and decent story. Ramdin Djawadi is truly a musical genius.

I would consider Season 7 to be weakest of them all. Make no mistake, it is still better than all other shows out there, but pales in comparison to the previous seasons. I disliked the fact that great conversation and dialogues that is an intricate part of GOT was missing in this season. You can't blame the show-runners as George RR Martin who is the best in crafting them hasn't written the book yet.

Eagerly waiting for the Season 8. From the trailers it seems to be filled with mammoth battles and fates of several characters will be decided."
1148,"The best TV Series ever...almost perfect except for the timing, the gaps between seasons it was just too long and the episodes just not enough..ha ha ha guess i'm just a sucker...Just have to deduct a star because of it. No comparison (it is the best tv series ever produce), just wish they make like 3-hour of 3 part movies like the lord of the rings in IMAX, that would be awesome. But then again, it is based on the book which may loose a lot of elements to it. People who compare this to the story of ramayana and mahabharata should be ignore. As I have mentioned before...this is a FICTION NOT EVEN A MYTH, after all, this is from a novel. It has got nothing to do with history and civilization. Please, be an educated adult, enjoy the series and stop calling on others and make comparison."
1149,"Many times heard and read in the Internet about the beautiful series Game of Thrones. A lot of jokes, mems, theories. Many times I heard that this is the best series because any character in it can die. So, it all turned out to be true. This series, like no other, has ever sunk into the poor behavior of the characters, except for some stupid, but tolerably cases. Never seen a bad or excessive play of actors. The entire series consists of only 8-10 episodes in each season, but each episode costs more than the whole season of many other series with 20-25 episodes. Beautiful music and OST's in general. The vast majority of modern conveyor films and series would be worth learning from THIS series... Hold the door..."
1150,I do wish it had more longevity and never ended. This is the first show I ever binge watched every season in my life !!
1151,Best TV show ever.....! A must watch show. Addicted on watching the show.
1152,"The writing of Game of Thrones is just phenomenal.

'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every ""country"", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books - but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.

This is the best TV-series ever."
1153,"Do not believe any of those negative reviews. Game of Thrones is the best TV-series ever. 'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every ""country"", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books - but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement."
1154,"No words for this show. Every thing is so well done and presented. Not predictable and the story is amazing plus the actions pack scenes, adventures simply mesmerizing. But it's the last season which feels me hard to believe."
1155,I loved the story...and would love to see GOT again and again....and i would have rated GOT more than 10 stars but IMDB..... GAME OF THRONES is the only TV series which wouldn't let me watch any other tv series....and I'm proudly a big fan of game of thrones... it's also in my must watch list...
1156,"Starks,Frays,Barathians,tyrels, lannisters, targeryans amongst many others and the irony of throne. Valar morghulis"
1157,Exciting series to watch for. Exciting series to watch for.
1158,"I wish it would never end! Been hooked since day one! When ""winter is coming"" to Jersey, a Game of Thrones marathon is the thing to do and it never gets old!"
1159,"In game of thrones there are so many twists and turns, that you don't know what to expect. It is the most intricate and elaborate show I've ever seen"
1160,I never thought anything could grip me like GOT Has! It's the best series I've ever seen for the third time. Just don't want it to ever end. ❤
1161,"This serie os my favorite, I recomend for someone who likes battle"
1162,"You really need a review for Game of thrones ?! This show has ruined my TV watching list progress, when you touch the sky you will never be satisfied in living on earth. This is the most amazing TV show I have ever seen (or will ever see I guess)."
1163,"For everyone that loves sex, violence, naked men and a good story, this show is for you"
1164,"Has great battles, and the suspense of anyone of the characters can die at anytime. During a battle you never know who can die."
1165,"At the time of its publishing, Tolkien's Lord of the Ring started out a reborn round of fantasy that took its elements from Wagner's operas and nordic legends. It was so powerful that it dominated the scene it created in novels, movies and games for more than 60 years. Until now.

Gone now are the elves, wizards, fair maidens and magical swords: Gone is the black and white morality; This is the new fantasy standard, a fantasy that's rich in intrigue, conflicting sides, shades of gray and less-than-noble sentiments. G Martin put the human element back into the fantasy setting, after Tolkien took it out. We can now talk about ""realistic fantasy"".

The first seasons shows the usual early mistakes these series have, as they throw things against the wall to see what sticks to it. It this case, the first season features exagerated hostility, obnoxious synthetisers, too many exploitative boudoir scenes and bizzare wigs, things that will be progressively pulled out or done with more subtility in the later ones.

I don't not grant 9s easily - but this is something historic we're witnessing here and now. A necessary add-on to any fantasy setting or politics aficionados' library out there."
1166,"This is a great show, but the casting decisions in some cases are incomprehensible.

Whoever plays Euron Greyjoy has all the gravitas of Richard Simmons.

So bad he detracts significantly from the show."
1167,"It took me 7 seasons in for me to watch this show. I was extremely curious as to what all the fuss and hype was about and let me start by saying that it is all warranted. This show has everything you could ever ask for: exceptional performances, characters you fall in love and form a connection with, beautiful special effects, insane plot twists that leave you with your jaw lying on the floor, intense action sequences, and so much more! This show takes my breath away and I will gladly admit that I am full on obsessed with it!"
1168,"It's simply a must watch if you like TV series. Excellent story, acting, characters that make it really addictive. One of the best I've ever seen."
1169,"One of the few that I want to keep watching. Even when you need to wait fooooooooor evveeerr to see when the winter is coming.

No really great show. Good acting. Everything fits. First session could be less ... Well when you see the session you will know what I mean."
1170,"This series is very much worth watching, but you can't jump in and think you'll figure out what's going on..you need to watch from the very first episode and pay attention! you won't regret it!"
1171,"It's unique and brilliant! I adore this show and can't wait to see how it all comes to an end in April. If you think it's rubbish, then you're rubbish!"
1172,There is nothing less than perfect 10 to rate this series. Its EPIC in all the ways. It has everything to keep you engrossed on the screen hours after hours.
1173,"It's the best one. Incredibly amazing. It's not matter whether you're fantasy lover or not, I bet you'll love it. This show's level is so high that any other show can't be comparable. I feel so bad for those people who still haven't watched this masterpiece. Just go & watch guys !!!!"
1174,For the next episode after that beautiful blue dragon FIRE! Why does it have to be the last season ?
1175,Game of Thrones is by far the best show I've ever watched. The special effects are on point. The acting is perfectly amazing. The storyline of the entire series upto season 7 I can not fault anything. I just can't wait for season 8 to come... been waiting year and half now.... tick tock.... Nevertheless this series is a masterpeice. George R.R. Martin your a absolute genius!
1176,"What can I say that haven't been said before? This is s fantastic show! I have read all the books ( waiting for the last two), and I have seen all seasons multiple times!

This show has everything! It will definitely get you in touch with every emotions tapped it untapped! You will actually find how hypocritically dark you are rooting for murder, betrayal, and incestous relationship! I will miss this show once the last season is over."
1177,This is the best show ever made period. Anyone who says different obviously lives on a different planet. The acting is amazing the story is so damn perfect. Everything from the CGI to the extras... This show is the GOAT. If you haven't already done so give it a go but don't start if you don't have at least 6 hours to burn because you won't want to stop watching..
1178,"Much better then Vikings, if you think about it.. Great story, twists, excelent post production.. Wow"
1179,I will be very emotional when this series comes to an end it truly is an amazing show
1180,"I don't know if I'm the first one who has noticed this. It's crystal clear that she is not accurately speaking any of the made-up languages. I wish they had chosen someone else for this pivotal role. Other than that, the series is really awesome. Can't get enough of Jon Snow!"
1181,"Book better than tv series? Don't make me laugh.

For a tv series this is 95/100. This 5 from 100 is because Daenerys thread is mostly boring.

Book in its genre compared to Malazans or The Black Company is 85/100."
1182,"It's hard to rate this show because the parts that take place mainly in Kings Landing (along with the storyline involving Brienne of Tarth and Sir Jamie) are excellent, like a medieval soap opera. The photography and sets are incredible, casting is great, as the acting is top notch. Pacing does lag (A LOT) here and there, but overall it's forgivable.

But for those who are not fans of the zombie genre, that's where this show totally loses me. I couldn't believe they integrated such a stupid thing into an otherwise good show. I wish the 'threat from beyond the wall' would have been something less adolescent. I'm all for suspending disbelief and going supernatural, but zombies are not only dumb, they have been so overdone it's not even 'fresh.' Some thinking outside the box and originality would have been appreciated.

So for all parts that weren't zombie, I'd give it an 8-9, and for the zombie drivel, a 0. A waste of good characters and storyline, I found myself fast forwarding through all zombie scenes stopping only to hear dialog from main characters when I thought it might be relevant to other parts of the show.

I will watch the last season to see how it all plays out at King's Landing but it's not like ""I can't wait"" ... the only reason I will watch it is because the parts I *do* like are so good. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother. And imho Peter does steal the show and deserved every Emmy. But everyone is excellent... even those at The Wall whose storylines were relegated to the the stupid zombie stuff."
1183,"The only show to make me neglect life itself, just to watch it. Bloody brilliant, can not wait for the last season."
1184,"I didn't start watching until season 6 was over. I needed something new to occupy my spare time. I stand by my initial impression; first two episodes of the season are good, middle season is usually pretty slow, second to last episode is the best, and season finale gets you excited for the next season. But then it repeats. Every mid-season felt like a chore to watch.

Recently I started rewatching it with my fiancé who had never seen the show and I'm enjoying it much more now! The season still plays out the same way with me but now I don't have the struggle of remembering who the characters are and learning what's going on. It's a good show with great acting and really awesome effects. It just didn't completely steal my heart like it did with most other people.

8/10 stars because it IS a good show. A little boring at times but maybe that's just me. Not everyone has to love every show."
1185,"La mejor en todo. Actuación, adaptación y ambientación."
1186,"I never read any novels until i saw this show, (three times), i then had to read the books, epic characters, the good and the bad, their all entertaining, a massive world with history's and lore's across the whole two continents of essos and westeros. I would say if you have not seen it, then rectify that please. Epic fantasy!"
1187,Just completed season-1. I know its too late but its amazing. All characters was well played mostly i like snow tyrien and khalees. I will see all the seasons. GOT
1188,"Put simply, the greatest TV series of all time.

Great cast, fabulous production, only flaw is they are 'dragging' the last couple of seasons out."
1189,Best show to ever be created!! So intense and keeps you wanting to come back for me! Love it
1190,Best tv show ever. If you don't like it you should go to doctor because there something wrong with you.
1191,I'm obsessed with GoT and will be devastated when it ends next year.
1192,All the amazing plot twists and the amazing story makes this the absolute best series I have ever watched!!!!
1193,"The best there is , the best there was and the best there will be."
1194,This show is amazing and what a wonderful casts. I can't wait for the season 8. Winter is coming!!!
1195,"Definitely one of the best shows ever, its probably in my top 5! I usely hate this type of show, set in late years but the plot in Game of thrones is just too good, and the characters are very badass. It might take a while to get hooked because the beginning is slow, but you fall in love with it later."
1196,"Near perfect show so far. The dialogue, acting and story telling is leagues above almost any other show that has ever aired."
1197,"I have never watch a season like this I can see where the controversy surrounding this film comes from but what I don't understand is where the hate is coming from. But lets try to understand the hate. This movie is here for one reason and I think that we can all agree on that reason. Oliver Stone is a competent and accomplished filmmaker and most of the hate seems to be directed towards him. Stone, who is working from a script that has since been virtually disowned by Quentin Tarantino, pretty much took over and shaped the screenplay to his own vision."
1198,"The only show that i saw that gets better with every season, i don't to spoil anything bat if you start watching GOT you can't stop."
1199,"Every since the first episode, there as been cliffhanging moments that want you to continue the show. It has all the great elements needed for a show like fantastic music, acting, dialogue, and camera work. I've watched the show about nine times now and every moment is a moment worth living again. Best TV series of our time!"
1200,When i first saw the game of throne it was the best moments of my life.i watched it 4 times. This is the best tv show ever .
1201,"One of the best TV series so far. Scenes actors and plot of the show is just amazing. Both writer and the directer of the story made a great job,"
1202,Excellent tv show i can not find any tv show as the same as this
1203,"A masterpiece. Truthfully, the greatest thing the film industry has ever produced. Same place in my heart as Lord Of The Rings series.

10/10"
1204,"At the beginning of this fantasy series I saw it as erotic and only meant for entertainment. As I proceeded I learnt depth of the philosophy hidden. This series is an expression of the weird yet true games played around the quest for power. At the same time it shows new elements like white walkers, faceless men that not heard. This is not only a fantasy but a philosophical work. Loved watching it and desperately waiting for the Season-8."
1205,I'll keep this short. Game of Thrones is the best television series ever made.
1206,"Game Of Thrones was well into its fifth season when I started watching it from my dads DVD's and I loved it. George R.R. Martin Is brilliant at the intricate storylines of each character and group, then weaving them in and amongst one-another, it takes some thinking about to remember all the strands (and the character names especially) but I can't wait for the next series"
1207,"This is one the best show i have ever watched whether it be special effects , performance , art direction and also superbly directed and written"
1208,"What a show u literally just can't write this stuff. Action packed from the beginning to the end, characters that will build relationships with u like nether before and episodes with mind bending endings will keep u guessing. The best ever show imo"
1209,"This show is superb! While I may be bias as the book series is my favourite book series of all, I still think the show itself is fantastic! It sticks loyally to the books and doesn't ""dumb things down"" for a wider audience. If you are worried you won't gain the same experience by watching the show before you read the books, fear not - It's the same experience, with a different medium!

Although, I guarantee, soon you will be so pulled into the world of Westeros you will run out and buy the books just to find out what happens next!

Sit back and enjoy, my friends - Winter is Coming!"
1210,Best show ever Best show ever Best show ever Best show ever
1211,Best show ever Best show ever Best show ever Best show ever
1212,"One of my favorite shows of all time, I just wish that we didn't have to wait so long between seasons!!!"
1213,"Eight seasons is OK for a show like this. After S5 you don't get any shocking surprises, there are some, but we just got used to the GoT-GRRM style. At this point we can predict the story because we have enough information, it is not a mystery anymore. We need fresh blood, new stories, new amazing actors, characters, i can't wait for all those rumored 4-5 prequels. GoT has been a lovely emotional roller coaster, we love it, it changed our lives a little bit. It changed our perspective of a GOOD show, quality not quantity. It is time to go. Let the prequels begin!"
1214,"When I try to predict where this show is heading, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the stupidest reason for someone's actions? What's the stupidest direction they might be heading? Picture every stupid scenario and every crappy line of dialogue all at once, in your mind and you'll never be disappointed."
1215,They started the show with intrigue and adventure with good guys and bd ones. Now? It's just a bunch of random bits that don't have you caring about or wanting any of the characters to win. The only character worth anything is Tyrian Lannister. Twelve seconds of Khaleesi and her dragons doesn't make a medieval storyline. The first three seasons were really good. Season four not so good. Season 5? I'm not sure I'll continue to waste my time
1216,This series is very nice... i really like this. all actors is very good in this movie.
1217,This series is very nice... i really like this. all actors is very good in this movie.
1218,"Truly amazing. The cast is perfect, as is their acting, the quality of the cinematography has gradually increased over the past few seasons, the special effects resemble a Hollywood production, the overall plot and characters and immersive and interesting, and the TV show itself is a roller-coaster of emotions. If you are looking for a TV show to start watching, GoT is your best option."
1219,"Game of Thrones is undoubtedly the most popular series of today, a super production of HBO based on the fantasy books of George Martin, the series has 7 season and probably the 8 and last will come out in 2019, Game of Thrones is a series that had its ups and downs, but it is undeniable that each season had at least one great episode, season 5 for example I consider the weakest in the series, was in my opinion much lower until episode 7, but we had 3 great final episodes which made the season stay above average, season 1 is in my opinion the best season of the series, is the one that had a better sequences, with 10 great episodes, highlight for the episode Baelor that shocked everyone who saw and showed that in Game of Thrones there is no one safe, the series has evolved a lot in terms of production, had incredible scales, the season 6 has the sensational episode Battle of Bastards that is incredible, had great vilans, in the case King Joffrey and Ramsey, the 7 season was very critical, I did not find it weak as they say, even with some problematic episode, the series knows how to shock the audience, the episode The Rains of Castamere, Game of Thrones also has many scenes spicy, the soundtrack is great Ned Stark, Jon Snow, Cersei, Jamie and etc, Game of Thrones is a great series, so far in its 7 seasons even with some problems, had all the seasons above average, I hope the 8 finish the series in style. Note 90

Note for season 1 Season - 97 2 Season - 91 3 Season - 89 4 Season - 93 5 Season - 84 6 Season - 86 7 Season - 88

Best Episodes 1 - Battle of the Bastards 2 - Hardhome 3 - Baelor 4 - The Spoils of War 5 - Winter is Coming"
1220,"Tactics and theatrics is the just one of the basic thing to be expected from this show and i know that the title is pretty straight forward but that's the best way to explain the reality of the show.The people in the show play a game of thrones and those who are strong and popular will win and those who are weak will lose and the price of losing is with their lives.So why it is so dark?Well as you can see in the photo behind you there are seven families with unique capabilities who fight for the throne with each of them moving like a wheel in a circular motion trying to top one another to be the best.You might think there might be a lot of prophecies about heroes who would one day rise up and break the wheel and you might be right.The mother of dragons.What? Sorry to just reveal this awesome information so early but yes there are dragons in the show.Yes more than one.Still skeptic about it.Well i'm gonna convince you to watch this show.

1221,"HBO... oh, HBO- going with the 'Limited Series'"" to maximize profit. They have bailed on some really promising shows, which leads me to believe that their cheaper offerings of 'Now', and 'Go' have bitten them in the ass! I feel the password-sharing era shall come to a close very soon. (ala Netflix). These 'Higher-Ups' have crazy visions/observations of where shows should go based on their tastes at any given moment. And there are obviously money issues going on, which leads me to believe that these 'Limited Series' deals will lessen their accountability in those upper-echelon positions. Eh, Capitalism... Winter is here for major cable."
1222,"At last, the piece of new enjoyment is here named as Game of Thrones season 6 that is what I was really waiting for. In trending news and contents, I found that season is gonna be awesome and will ride over the last seasons. Many epic and hot news are popping over the internet. Also many questions are getting heads up. All I found for that is here on IMDb. Viral news is that Barak Obama has seen the season in advance. Wish for that so. Anyone, who like to suggest me some sites to watch the season online? I want the flash back with previous seasons also.

1223,"I delayed watching this show for a long time. And i regret it. It has to be the best shows out there. Acting is superb, plot is good too. And, shock value is extreme. Some people complain that their favorite characters are getting killed. But this is what makes them different from other shows. Its unpredictability is its usp.

Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. This is what the plot in short is. We come to see betrayals, seduction, secrets, loyalty etc.

There are a lot of people who complain about nudity, but there is not that much. But yes its show meant for the adults. Every season comes up with new twists and turns. I finished watching 4 seasons in just 2 weeks. and now looking forward to the 5th season. 10/10 for me."
1224,"I think the show really captures its audience, not through CGI dragons and mystical lands and what not, but through the idea of power and what it can do. The show captures the evolving nature of characters facing hard choices that call for even harder decisions, for example the evolving of Daenerys's character throughout the whole show is by itself a good reason to keep watching the show, and this could really apply to everyone else. This is an important asset that we do not see that often with shows nowadays, most shows are focusing on attracting the audience rather than building a solid storyline to carry through the show. When I first watched GOT, I got hooked fast, because I was just bored watching the same ideas over and over again ( cops shows, medical crew shows, housewives shows, detective shows) Definitely one of my all time favorite shows."
1225,"Game of thrones is an increasingly hard TV series to review. I started the show during the third season but have since invested a lot of time to the book series and have started to understand the amazing complexity that George RR Martin has weaved throughout his emotional masterpiece. Sadly, the TV show cant replicate this complexity of each character development and plot line but it can give the audience an enjoyable, funny, clever but somewhat lacking version of ASOIAF. If one watches the show without the books, one will enjoy the events even though they are tough to witness and recall the tragedies of recent emotional stories such as the Wire. But a book reader will be ultimately left with a shallow view of the multi dimensional stories that they have read throughout 5 books. The performances are excellent but the characters themselves pale next to the complex characteristics of each character in terms of psychology and what GRR Martin considers the apex of ASOIAF: The human heart in conflict with itself."
1226,"This adaptation (so far) is without a doubt the best I've ever seen. Few books ever make the transformation from script to screen without loosing something monstrously important to whomever has read it and taken it to heart. We can all reel them off..

HBO really have pulled it out of the bag with Game of Thrones. The sets, characters and costumes are perfect, they've even kept huge segments of dialog exactly the same. The location, the characters, the king's road, the dragon egg's, the mad king, the loyal friend, the bastards, the dwarfs, the traitors, the plotters, the unholy lovers, the pet-wolves, the night's watch, the WALL, the blue eyed spirits of the haunted forest, the prince with blonde hair, the tyranny surrounding the word Khal Drogo, the gulf of grief, the chameleon Baelish, and much much more!

This show is so damn Good"
1227,"Considering episode 9 I was expecting much more from the season finale unfortunately there's only two words that can describe this last episode BIG DISAPPOINTMENT ... if you add to that, that we have to wait one year for the next episode / season it becomes more than that, it becomes TOTAL FAILURE with the added bonus of ruining the whole thing. So besides being total crap the actual story didn't develop much as you would expect from a season finale episode but on the contrary it left a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT feeling. The show is one of the best currently there's no denying in that and it had up's and down's like all have and so far it was good and entertaining, too bad about this last episode it was like the creators run out of ideas / lack of inspiration / professionalism. I can understand to leave some things unresolved that creates the desire to see next season in viewers but to add new stuff and let them also (totally) unexplained is amateur work, it should have been an ""explosive"" season finale considering the previous episode which was very good and raised my expectations for the finale a lot. I wont probably remember next year to watch the next season because of the bitterness I felt with this season finale. Shame ..."
1228,"I am a huge movies fan and when it comes to TV shows till recently I didn't follow any specific show, the first season of Game of Thrones was the ticket for me back to the TV arena.

I will start by saying that I literally advised to most of my friends and family to view the show. were it the production, screen writing or casting I can't give a credit to only one it's the whole that made the show what it was. immediately after viewing the show I have read the entire book series and was amazed to realize that there were barely slight differences between the first book to the first season - a thing that is known to be very difficult to find.

The show's storyline is thrilling and keep you on your toes from episode to episode, for anyone that loves medieval theme or/and political struggle with a bit of fantasy in it this is the perfect show.

This is till the second season. People say the higher the expectation the harder the blow is, but in my opinion it wasn't the expectations that made the second season a failure (in comparison to the first one)rather a misread of the audience. I regret to say that in my opinion the team behind the show decided to sacrifice storyline to advance minor affairs between the characters. tweaking the story and the way it effects the characters - and even worse killing or even removing characters in from the books.

I don't know how will they be able to fix it but while the first season is on the rating of 10 for me the second is barely reaching the 6.

would recommend seeing the first season alone and read the rest - hoping for the third season to get better again."
1229,"Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.

^^The series follows the books very closely, so its no surprise that the movie seems ""gloomy"" as the books have been given reviews along this same path. There are a few sections that drag, like any book, but for the most part it moves pretty fast, and beware, Martin has zero allegiance to his character, hint, hint, and the last episode is proving of that. Again, the story follows the books well, I guess this explains why we Martin book readers were pulling our hair out waiting for the next book, because he is HELPING make the dang thing...er...I fear the next book is going to be just as painfully long away in making!"
